The box labeled Hard disk (no sandbox) shows changes by a program running normally. The box labeled Hard disk (with sandbox) shows changes by a program running under Sandboxie. The animation illustrates that Sandboxie is able to intercept the changes and isolate them within a sandbox, depicted as a yellow rectangle. It also illustrates that grouping the changes together makes it easy to delete all of them at once. \n\nBenefits of the Isolated Sandbox\n\nSecure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded trivially. \nEnhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows. \nSecure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system. \nWindows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software into an isolated sandbox \n\n\n--Let op..dit is de X32 versie\n\n- Lees -!|altijd|!- het *.nfo bestand vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³r installatie.\n- Keygenerators/patches/cracks etc. kunnen virusscanners op hol laten slaan, is vals alarm.\n- Toch twijfels? &gt;&gt; Installeer dan niet. \n- Vragen? &gt;&gt;&gt; Google gebruiken! \n\nWebsite: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHashcode:\n37F8A96F1944E3295CA3512027E48B6D9B3D54C2\n\nNLT-RELEASE IS TERUG KOM SNEL NAAR DE SITE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nlt-release.nl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nlt-release.nl&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nBy Linday ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37f8a96f1944e3295ca3512027e48b6d9b3d54c2","amp;dn":"Sandboxie.x32.v3.60.%282011%29NLT-Release","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37f8a96f1944e3295ca3512027e48b6d9b3d54c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,248,169,111,25,68,227,41,92,163,81,32,39,228,139,109,155,61,84,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
