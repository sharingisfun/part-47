He also produced the play about Elvis Presley with PJ Proby starring (until he got fired for improvising). Jack Good once wrote about  Proby:\n\n-Proby can not only sing the pants of anyone else in the world, he even sing the pants off himself.\n\nHere are three american TV-shows from 1965, which show Proby in seven appearances. Shindig from June 16th, Shivaree from July 17th and Shivaree from September 18th. \n\nOther artists include Everly Brothers, Gerry and the Pacemakers, The Temptations and the Supremes.\n\nMore American TV- and radioshows from the fifties and sixties can be found at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~ahmintz/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~ahmintz/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3518857d24513f93a6519e15448e83f77dd46dd","amp;dn":"PJ+Proby+in+Shindig+%26+Shivaree","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3518857d24513f93a6519e15448e83f77dd46dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,81,136,87,210,69,19,249,58,101,25,225,84,72,232,63,119,221,70,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
