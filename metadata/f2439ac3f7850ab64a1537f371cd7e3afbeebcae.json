Anyone can play and search for treasures. In the movie, four twentysomethings who are in the game of geohunting fall for a trap set by a killer who chooses them for their notoriety on websites such as YouTube. The treasure-hunters become the hunted and thrill-seeking turns to survival as their adventure is broadcast on the web by the killer in a twisted reality show.\n\nNote:Occasional Black and White screens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2439ac3f7850ab64a1537f371cd7e3afbeebcae","amp;dn":"Are+You+Scared+2+DVDSCR+XviD-iFN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2439ac3f7850ab64a1537f371cd7e3afbeebcae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,67,154,195,247,133,10,182,74,21,55,243,113,205,126,58,251,238,188,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
