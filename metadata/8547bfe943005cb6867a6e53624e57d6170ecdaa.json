This has fluxbox 1.3.5. Built using ubuntu precise \n\n Get it here\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.smokey01.com/Oldyeller/FluxPup/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.smokey01.com/Oldyeller/FluxPup/&lt;/a&gt; \n\nIt is 150mb the devx is also there. \n\n I removed jwm but will be making pets and uploading them to server just in case someone would want jwm.(don't know why   ). \n\n Will be building some new programs just for FluxPup. There is no desk icons. \n\n The SFS_Builder_Downloader is a program to download everything that I have in fluxpup repo so one cn build adrv, zdrv and sfs. Read the help to know what you can do. This needs to be heavily tested to make sure all links work and are for the right program. I did a lot of this already, But could have missed one. \n\n\n Whats new in 1.5 \n ffconvert 1.4 \n firewallstate \n SFS_Builder_Downloader \n\n\n What has been Added: \n Adrive support \n pwidgets starts right up \n wbar has all the desk icons plus a few more \n opera has been put in and seamonkey is out \n\n Enjoy testing \n\n Cheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8547bfe943005cb6867a6e53624e57d6170ecdaa","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_FluxPup_archive_27-Mar-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8547bfe943005cb6867a6e53624e57d6170ecdaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,71,191,233,67,0,92,182,134,122,110,83,98,78,87,214,23,14,205,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
