Singer: Military robots and the future of war\n\nIn this powerful talk, P.W. Singer shows how the widespread use of robots in war is changing the realities of combat. He shows us scenarios straight out of science fiction -- that now may not be so fictitious.\n\nPeter Warren Singer is the director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative at the Brookings Institution -- where his research and analysis offer an eye-opening take on what the 21st century holds for war and foreign policy. His latest book, Wired for War, examines how the US military has been, in the words of a recent US Navy recruiting ad, &quot;working hard to get soldiers off the front lines&quot; and replacing humans with machines for bombing, flying and spying. He asks big questions: What will the rise of war machines mean to traditional notions of the battlefield, like honor? His 2003 book Corporate Warriors was a prescient look at private military forces. It's essential reading for anyone curious about what went on to happen in Iraq involving these quasi-armies. \n\nSinger is a prolific writer and essayist (for Brookings, for newspapers, and for Wired.comÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great Threat Level), and is expert at linking popular culture with hard news on whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s coming next from the military-industrial complex. Recommended: his recent piece for Brookings called &quot;A Look at the Pentagon's Five-Step Plan for Making Iron Man Real.&quot;\n\n    &quot;Singer's strength lies in the way that he has meticulously pulled together practically all the available evidence and research.&quot;\n\nNew York Review of Books","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f897a92650b1156a1dfab4f70009c6f9cc7f4e80","amp;dn":"P.W.+Singer%3A+Military+robots+and+the+future+of+war","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f897a92650b1156a1dfab4f70009c6f9cc7f4e80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,151,169,38,80,177,21,106,29,250,180,247,0,9,198,249,204,127,78,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
