Crew are of course Dave Brock, Alan Davey, and Richard Chadwick.  \n\n78 minutes of excellent audience recording and the cover's not bad, though of course not from this gig or tour (looks like Harvey on the front, and that's Huw on the back). Timing's from the tracks, not the CD cover.\n\nNeedle Gun (5.11)\nEjection/Time We Left (9.03)\nBlue Shift/The Right Stuff (12.26)\nSnake Dance/Night of the Hawks (10.32)\nLevitation (12.23)\nMaster of the Universe (5.42)\nThe Golden Void (7.00)\nParanoia/Hassan I Sahba (7.17)\nLSD (9.08)\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:974e19515ee493c208335d6a458aa14053c58a1b","amp;dn":"Hawkwind+-+Kings+of+Speed%2C+Lords+of+Light+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"974e19515ee493c208335d6a458aa14053c58a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,78,25,81,94,228,147,194,8,51,93,106,69,138,161,64,83,197,138,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
