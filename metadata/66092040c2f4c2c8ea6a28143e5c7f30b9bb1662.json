The cost of each new discovery averages $800 million, industry officials have claimed. But Goozner argues that citizens are already paying much of that bill: taxpayer-financed medical research, he finds, has played a major role in each important medical discovery. Goozner convincingly argues that new drugs get into the hands of the sick not thanks to drug and biotech companies, but to the passion of dedicated scientistsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in both the private sector and the public. A former Chief Economics Correspondent for the Chicago Tribune and an award-winning journalist, Goozer writes with skill and elegance, incorporating anecdote and history in a way that enlivens his research and makes his book an engrossing read. Though the issue of drug costs has been discussed extensively in the media, GoozerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s study puts all the political chatter, news coverage and analystsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ reports into a context where they finally make sense. \nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
