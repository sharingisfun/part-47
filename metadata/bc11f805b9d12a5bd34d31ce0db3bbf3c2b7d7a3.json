Sure its ever colorful Maison compilations ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ almost ten of them now ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ have become the reference in everything thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new and quirky in the world of pop, breaking today many of tomorrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s important artists. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also an elegant ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ young and modern ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ clothing line based on quality that keeps on expanding and is soon turning into a bit of a phenomena in Japan.\n\nOn the other, Ponystep, the noted fashion-style webmag based in east London has built a global reputation for all things fashion, art and music. It also happens to throw some of the best parties around. No wonder, the man behind Ponystep is Richard Mortimer infamous for his BoomBox night, which rocked the British capital and shook fashion circles the world over. BoomBoxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sense of freedom and electro/pop party brought a breath of fresh air to clubland and attracted celebrities (BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk, Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Jeremy ScottÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦) along with LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fashion elite (Giles Deacon, Gareth Pugh, Henry Holland, Christopher Kane, Marios SchwabÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦).\n\nAfter KitsunÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© released the BoomBox cd in 2007, an iconic snapshot of what was possibly the wildest club in the world at the time, the pairing is once more in full effect with Jerry Bouthier in the dj seat again. Bridging the Channel gap effortlessly, the Parisian relocated in London is MortimerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s long-time musical collaborator-resident dj and also part of the KitsunÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© family since early days. Sealing a vibrant appreciation based on mutual respect, KitsunÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©-Ponystep ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the ultimate fashion CD? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ of course aims at mixing London edge to Parisian chic, two highly stylish and defined worlds yet quite apart from each other. BouthierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reputation as catwalk dj keeps on growing, notably since he was taken on board at Vivienne Westwood to provide the music to all her shows. He is a regular at the Fashion Weeks, season after season he produces the runway soundtracks of other fashion designers showing in London (Jonathan Saunders, Roksanda Illincic, Peter Jensen, OsmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦) or Paris (Romain Kremer, JunnJ, Estrella Archs, SongZio).\n\nFusing pop, electro, indie, disco and more, KitsunÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©- Ponystep mixes tracks and remixes from some of the hottest names around (Roisin Murphy, French Horn Rebellion, Booka Shade, Aeroplane, Lindstrom, MunkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦); a truly international cast that goes as far as Sydney, Perth, NYC, Oslo, Berlin, Munich, Manchester and inevitably Paris and London. Seventy minutes designed to make you danceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and also, at times, move you. In todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s troubled times, emotion has become fashionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s latest by-word and is certainly an essential ingredient here: plenty of songs, with vocals and people playing instruments such as new Xenomania artist Florrie, Northern IrelandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest Two Door Cinema Club, BelgiumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Das Pop, ViennaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Bunny Lake, SwedenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Lo-Fi Fnk, David E SugarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a far cry from the dull thump you often find associated with fashion soundtracks. As such KitsunÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©-Ponystep is not just a dj mix, Andrea Gorgerino, BouthierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s studio side-kick and half of their recording project JBAG (also a versatile dj unit that has remixed Ladyhawke, Kylie, Sparks and SExpress), knows like no other how to apply magic, and a bit of drama, as he does on the shows to enhance the aural experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc11f805b9d12a5bd34d31ce0db3bbf3c2b7d7a3","amp;dn":"Kitsun%C3%83%C2%A9+x+Ponystep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc11f805b9d12a5bd34d31ce0db3bbf3c2b7d7a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,17,248,5,185,209,42,91,211,77,49,206,13,179,187,243,194,183,215,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
