Based in Las Vegas from 1994 through 1998 they played in and subsequently were banned from a number of local venues. While still active they released one recording, Karaoke Abattoir, which stands as their defining document. Karaoke Abattoir gives 72 minutes of insight into the nature of Nature Boy, but only hints at the insanity of their live shows, which have been described as 'hilarious' and 'orgasmic.' Nature Boy! was notorious for their conspicuous consumption of drugs and alcohol, often performing live under the influence of mushrooms or LSD. This profile is dedicated to the memory of Nature Boy! The Dangerous Insect Audio label plans to re-release on CD the previously cassette-only Karaoke Abattoir, as well as a new posthumous release New Death Experience. There is also a large trove of unreleased material waiting to be mined for future release.\n\n\nKaraoke Abattoir\n\n01 Cum Over Hear 1:54\n02 Masturbatory Clash 1:01\n03 I Wanna Be A Bug 6:50\n04 Blue Number Two 3:16\n05 Basement Bop 1:17\n06 This Way Long Before 3:44\n07 Dead Boy 3:05\n08 A Perfect God 1:01\n09 An Authority Figure Figures It Out 4:28\n10 Fuck The Shit 2:17\n11 Dead Girl 4:35\n12 A Mighty Christ 1:10\n13 Lighter Jam 1:29\n14 Fallen Graven Image 0:58\n15 Gold Star For Radio Boy 2:07\n16 Eye Really Wanna Hear It 1:08\n17 Here I Am 1:28\n18 Blue Number One 3:54\n19 Eye Can Be Free 1:49\n20 Beautiful Mess 6:15\n21 Sunrise Bird Song 1:04\n22 Sensitive Material and Public Service Announcement 6:28\n23 Initiation Brainwash 8:19\n\n\nbit rate: 256Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d52ecef4158a6621ed39fc72d3e87c0042fe901","amp;dn":"Karaoke+Abattoir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d52ecef4158a6621ed39fc72d3e87c0042fe901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,82,236,239,65,88,166,98,30,211,159,199,45,62,135,192,4,47,233,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
