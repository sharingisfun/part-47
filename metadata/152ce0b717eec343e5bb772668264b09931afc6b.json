The high-energy radiation blazing out \n\nfrom the hot, young stars in NGC 3324 is sculpting the wall of the nebula by slowly\n\neroding it away.\n\nThis image is a composite of data taken with two of Hubble&amp;#039;s science instruments. \n\nData taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) in 2006 isolated light emitted\n\nby hydrogen. More recent data, taken in 2008 with the Wide Field Planetary Camera2 \n\n(WFPC2), isolated light emitted by sulfur and oxygen gas. \n\nTo create a color composite, the data from the sulfur filter are represented by \n\nred, from the oxygen filter by blue, and from the hydrogen filter by green.\n\n\nHD Quality: 1028x720 \nFormat:     wmv\n\nPlease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\n\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\n\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:152ce0b717eec343e5bb772668264b09931afc6b","amp;dn":"HD%3A+Pan+Across+Star-Forming+Region+NGC+3324+in+the+Carina+Nebula","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"152ce0b717eec343e5bb772668264b09931afc6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,44,224,183,23,238,195,67,229,187,119,38,104,38,75,9,147,26,252,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
