Or so he thinks. But shortly after arrival he has to find out that the palace he expected really looks more like a run-down shabby mansion. In addition, the young and attractive lawyer he takes to bed that night does not wake up the next morning. After being released from prison, Fletch starts investigating about the murder, an enormous sum of money offered for his rather worthless piece of land, about TV priest Jimmy Lee Farnsworth and his Bibleland and about tons of toxic waste on his ground. Additionally, someone is after Fletch with a serious gun pointed at him. But they all underestimated Fletch, whose journalistic instinct always leads him into the right direction - hopefully. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097366/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097366/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo: \nOptimized for AppleTV\nH.264 \n640 x 352\n25 FPS\n\nAudio:\nAAC\nStereo (L R)\n44.100 kHz\n\nDuration: 0:01:31:00.96\n\nConverted from AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba9413d8a2c7e74441ce13a6b4315e0f9ec5339","amp;dn":"Fletch+Lives+%281989%29+%5BAppleTV%5D+%5Bmp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba9413d8a2c7e74441ce13a6b4315e0f9ec5339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,169,65,61,138,44,126,116,68,28,225,58,107,67,21,224,249,236,83,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
