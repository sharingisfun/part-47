Newmeyer\n\nOne of LloydÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal favorites of his films, GrandmaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Boy is a beautiful tale of self-discovery, with a bounty of comic overtones. Sonny is a self-professed coward who balks at the sight of the town tramp (Sutherland). Armed with a lucky charm given to him by his grandmother (Townsend), he defeats the tramp and the town bully (Stevenson), learning a very valuable lesson about himself in the process.\n\nA standout contributor to the art of silent film comedy, Harold Lloyd (1893-1971) offers new generations a body of film work that is as fresh and entertaining as in its day. His roots were simple ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ born in rural Nebraska, product of a broken home, and initially destined for the legitimate stage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ yet by the 1920s, Lloyd was, both at the box office and in the polls, the most popular comic actor in the world.\n\nHis appeal was simple, yet legendary: through his Glass Character, which formed the basis of roles from 1917-1947, Lloyd struck gold with a screen persona that forged new ground. The Boy, as he was most often called, had one trademark ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lens-less horn-rimmed glasses ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ yet was able to reach audiences as no contemporary could. He is regarded as the man who most greatly influenced eyeglass-wearing in America, and this single facet of Lloyd inspired youth worldwide. His screen normalcy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in look and demeanor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ allowed moviegoers to relate to the Glass Character no matter what his label. Rich or poor, cowardly or flip, from film to film, Lloyd was a different Boy, and was able to create a cinematic legacy that remains both diverse and uniformly thrilling.\n\nHarold Lloyd might just be the funniest actor youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never seen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a silent screen comedian so often placed in the shadow of Chaplin and Keaton -- but he continues to shine in some of the most enduring short- and feature-length comedies ever offered to audiences.\n \nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Grandma's Boy (1922)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\Grandma's Boy (1922)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                   : OpenDML\nFile size                        : 1.25 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 1mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 914 Kbps\nWriting application              : Lavf51.12.1\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : xvid\nCodec ID                         : xvid\nDuration                         : 1h 1mn\nBit rate                         : 2 582 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 540 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.277\nStream size                      : 1.11 GiB (89%)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 1mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 140 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 26 ms (0.63 video frame)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97UUR\u0011B\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5739\n2/11/2011 1:31:31 AM\nmbam-log-2011-02-11 (01-31-31).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 5\nTime elapsed: 20 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
