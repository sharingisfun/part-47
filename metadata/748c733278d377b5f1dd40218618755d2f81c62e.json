November 2010.pdf\n\nEnglish | PDF | 84 pages | 9.9 Mb\n\n\nThere are many roads to jazz, as any collection of fans will demonstrate. \nBut for many of those fans, whose age today can fall anywhere between 10 \nand 80, that road has been paved with issues of Down Beat magazine.\n\nOver the decades it has instructed, recommended, criticized, praised, \ncondemned, advocated and, in the aggregate, honored the most dynamic \nAmerican music of the twentieth century. Millions have been led to records \nand artists on the strength of a Down Beat review, news tip, or profile. \nIt has shaped young tastes in need of guidance and challenged older ones \nin need of a wake up call. In the 1930s, before any important book on jazz \nhad yet been written, Down Beat collected the first important body of \npre 1935 jazz history. It became a monthly, then semi monthly, a diary \nof the swing era as it happened, then tracked the progression of bop, \npop, rock, freedom, fusion, and nineties neoclassicism, all from the \nperspective of the musician. Hard to believe it began by selling insurance.\n\nYou Cant Sell em Both\n\nAlbert J. Lipschultz was neither a full time musician nor a professional \njournalist. He had no interest in leading a band, acquiring power, or \neditorializing on the affairs of the world.\n\nAl Lipschultz had only one interest. That was selling insurance. After \nwashing out as a saxophone player in Chicago during the years of World \nWar I, he looked for better opportunities. Soon he found one that let him \nuse his contacts in music. Starting in 1921, he began to cultivate an \ninsurance clientele of working Chicago musicians. He took a special interest \nin savings plans and annuities that promised musicians a monthly retirement \nincome.\n\nLipschultz was not the only Chicagoan to take an interest in the welfare and \nfinancial security of musicians, however. There was James C. Petrillo, president \nof Local 10 of the American Federation of Musicians and one of the most \ncommanding and aggressive some would say reckless figures in the American \nlabor movement. The fact that the thirties was to be labors moment at the \nmoral center of American politics gave him even greater power. Anything that \nconcerned musicians concerned Petrillo.\n\nIn the early thirties, as Lipschultz concentrated on building his insurance \nbusiness, he began to see an opportunity that offered benefit to both \nhimself and his customers. There was a need, he felt, for a musicians \nnewspaper beyond the house organ of the AFM local. So in the summer of \n1934, as the Century of Progress Exposition swung into its second season \nalong Chicagos lakefront, Lipschultz took a small office on the eighth \nfloor of the Woods Theater building on Clark and Dearborn, setting himself \nup as president of Albert J. Lipschultz &amp; Associates, publisher. He called \nhis new magazine Down Beat, and it went on sale, all eight pages, in July \n1934 for 10 cents an issue.\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:748c733278d377b5f1dd40218618755d2f81c62e","amp;dn":"Down+Beat+Magazine.+November+2010.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"748c733278d377b5f1dd40218618755d2f81c62e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,140,115,50,120,211,119,181,241,221,64,33,134,24,117,93,47,129,198,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
