TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been around since 2003, and the bit of into that grabbed me were these words used to describe their style: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ[they are] known for exciting stage shows that combine rock, funk, soul, blues and pop, with an expansive improvisational element.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nI go on reading and see that Music Connection named them one of LAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s top unsigned bands in 2008, and that their debut EP, ElePhant, was produced by Dave Cobb (Shooter Jennings, Jack White, Nico Vega). Well, that pretty much sealed the deal for meÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ so I took their song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGet Back JackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for a spin, dug it, and here I am now writing about them for you to check out.\n\nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the chain of events that led us here.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGet Back JackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ feels like a romp through New Orleans, thanks to singer Steven RothsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drawlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a solid song through and through, anchored by a hammering piano that definitely sets the tone. The song sounds like it was teleported from way back when, and I think thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just fine with Redstone Hall.\n\n\nAs their press release statesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n&lt;&lt;The players were still in high school when Redstone Hall started. They evolved rapidly from a jam band to a more focused pop outfit, drawing on the sounds of the classic soul and rock of the 60s and 70s.&gt;&gt;\n\n\n\nRedstone Hall may be looking back for their inspiration, but they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t come across as trying to recreate anything. For me, their style has no problems standing out from the packÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ RothsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice invites you in and keeps you there. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m digging their sound and want to hear more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e3e3e4c914b2188402ed2315bfbcfe4eed6f846","amp;dn":"Redstone+Hall+-+ElePhant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e3e3e4c914b2188402ed2315bfbcfe4eed6f846","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,62,62,76,145,75,33,136,64,46,210,49,91,251,207,228,238,214,248,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
