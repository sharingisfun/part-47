He wants to get her fixed because he thinks he loves her. But in post apocalyptic LA, there aren&amp;#039;t any parts. He hears a rumor of a giant warehouse of Cherrys out in the wasteland. The problem is getting there, and getting back alive. To improve his odds he hires a tracker named E. Johnson (Melanie Griffith) who turns out to be a very unique and real woman, something that Sam has never encountered before. As E and Sam fight their way across the wasteland and into the warehouse, Sam learns a little something about real women and real love.\n  Of the many post-apocapyptic thrillers following the success of Mad Max, this is a good one. There is a full blown plot and a moral to the story. The action is good, and Griffith is great. It&amp;#039;s one of those guilty pleasure movies that you are embarrassed to admit that you like. It&amp;#039;s very easy and fun to watch making it one that you will watch more than once.\n\n  Starring: Melanie Griffith, David Andrews, Tim Thomerson, Jennifer Balgobin, Ben Johnson, Marshall Bell, Harry Carey Jr., Laurence Fishburne.\n\n  Directed by: Steve De Jarnatt.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  1hr. 38min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x  400\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4073e70af1f44456ea8c14216b1c3ac1138a1342","amp;dn":"Cherry+2000+%281988%29+%28Melanie+Griffith%2C+David+Andrews%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4073e70af1f44456ea8c14216b1c3ac1138a1342","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,115,231,10,241,244,68,86,234,140,20,33,107,28,58,193,19,138,19,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
