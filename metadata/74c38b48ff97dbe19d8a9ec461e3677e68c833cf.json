They are the accomplished architects of house and progressive breakbeat who ventured further beyond the ecstatic knee-jerk response of the dancefloor by fusing their beats with powerful orchestral and cinematic soundscapes.\n\nAfter DJing separately at Welsh clubs throught the late 80&amp;#039;s and early 90&amp;#039;s, Hybrid formed back in 1993 after bonding over Truman&amp;#039;s remix of Pink Floyd&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Another Brick In The WallÃƒÂ¢??. Their 1999 debut LP (with former member Lee Mullin) &amp;#039;Wide Angle&amp;#039; sold a total of 100,000 copies world wide. &quot;We like making music that will last,&quot; explains Healings. &quot;Music that isn&amp;#039;t disposable. We want people to listen to it over and over again in the future.&quot; &quot;Music you can play before you go out and listen to when you chillout,&quot; continues Truman.\n\nHybrid have collaborated with artists such as New Order&amp;#039;s Peter Hook, The Pretender&amp;#039;s Chrissie Hynde, Kirsty Hawkshaw, Julee Cruise and the 90-piece Russian Federal Orchestra.\n\nHybrid has also remixed over 40 artists including Radiohead, 2 Bad Mice, Alanis Morissette, Carl Cox, BT, The Future Sound Of London and Moby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n\n\nBSW Presents - The Hybrid Remixes\n\n\n01.
