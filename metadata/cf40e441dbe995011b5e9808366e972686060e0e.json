A comprehensive list of issues fixed in this release is included below: \n\nStability and High Severity Bugs - Fixed\n\nLightroom could crash when switching to or from the web module on Windows Vista 64. \nSelecting a custom camera profile or using auto-white balance could cause a spinning ball. \nPreference files pointing to missing catalogs could prevent Lightroom from progressing past the registration dialog. \nErrors could occur when attempting to create a virtual copy with a computer that has a processor that is not SSE2 enabled. (This is a method of delivering instructions to the processor which was introduced with the Pentium 4 processor. It should not have affected a significant number of modern machines.) \nModal dialogs could try to appear on a disabled second monitor, causing Lightroom to appear hung or unresponsive. \nWhen a DNG file was selected for export to a derivative TIFF file and it is added to the catalog at export there was a possibility that one of the files could be treated as a sidecar within Lightroom such that deleting one file deletes both. \nPerformance Bugs - Fixed\nAttempting to import a large number of images that already exist within the Lightroom catalog could cause significant performance delays. \nThe image counts that appear next to each folder could appear to populate slowly. \nLightroom scanned the calibration profile directory excessively when switching collections. \nThe &amp;#039;three dot&amp;#039; indicator in the grid view persisted longer than necessary. \nThe Mac 64-bit version did not have SSE2 optimization, causing reduced rendering speeds. \nMemory leaks in the Library and Develop modules decreased Lightroom performance. \nApplying keywords via presets or on import could greatly decrease import performance. \nFolder synchronizing could experience significant performance decreases. \nKeywords and Metadata - Fixed\nKeywords from Lightroom 1.4 were not included on image export by default. (Please note that catalogs upgraded from Lightroom 1.4 using Lightroom 2.1 will not have this issue, but catalogs upgraded from 1.4 using 2.0 will still need to use the script posted at our technical support site at: http://www.adobe.com/go/kb405074.) \nLightroom stopped rendering previews prior to completion on files with metadata changes applied by other applications. \nThe &quot;Any Searchable Field&quot; search option did not find caption text. \nPhotoshop Interop - Fixed\nEdit in Photoshop did not work correctly or at all for some customers. \nCopyright Status and Info URL fields were not transferred when a file was created from Lightroom for use in Photoshop. \nXMP metadata from the IDimager application was not carried over during an Edit in Photoshop operation. \nFiles with an ampersand in the file name were not added back to the Lightroom Library after an Edit in Photoshop session. \nChoosing to Edit in Photoshop from a folder with an apostrophe in the name would cause the feature to fail. \nCertain NEF files were rotated incorrectly when opened into Photoshop from Lightroom. \nMiscellaneous Troubling Items - Fixed\nRe-importing missing photos from an exported catalog could ignore the setting &amp;#039;preserve old settings as virtual copy.&amp;#039; \nChoosing to undo a slider adjustment in Lightroom on Windows would cause two undo steps to occur if the slider was still under active mouse selection. \nLights Out mode could flicker on Windows when the detail panel was selected in the Develop module. \nThe crop aspect ratio could revert to the last selected ratio even when it had been reset to original. \nThe spot tool might not switch from clone to healing mode upon request if the brush was above a certain size. \nCertain ORF files were not read by Lightroom. \nDuring import and conversion to DNG, file renaming could use the operating system&amp;#039;s date stamp rather than the fileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s EXIF date. \nPanoramic images printed with a portrait layout and utilizing the auto layout functionality would cause images to print at a low resolution. \n\nPending Investigations\n\nThe following are issues that are still under investigation and not fixed in this release: \nCatalogs with hundreds of root (top level) folders can cause very slow launch times. We are currently testing a fix for this but need more time to evaluate it. As a workaround, try right-clicking a root folder and choosing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAdd Parent FolderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ until the number of folders at the left-most level of the Folders hierarchy is significantly reduced. \nWe are still working on additional methods to improve the performance of the new Localized Correction features. \nCamera Support\n\nNewly supported camera models include: \n\nFuji Finepix IS Pro \nNikon D700 \nNikon D90 \nNikon Coolpix P6000\n\nIn addition Kelby&amp;#039;s book about the program (in v.1 version but better than nothing), which can be used as a manual.\n\nAnd one nice thing - the RC version does not write anything to the EXIF data. so it identifies as the firmware of your camera.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf40e441dbe995011b5e9808366e972686060e0e","amp;dn":"Adobe+Photoshop+Lightroom+2.1+RC+EN+for+Win+32+%26+64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf40e441dbe995011b5e9808366e972686060e0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,64,228,65,219,233,149,1,27,94,152,8,54,110,151,38,134,6,14,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
