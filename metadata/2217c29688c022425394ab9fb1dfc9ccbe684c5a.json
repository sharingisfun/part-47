We remember, especially, the dead and those who carry the physical wounds of war. But, what of those with the invisible injuries, the crippling wounds of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)? \n\nIn Broken Heroes, Gillian Findlay introduces us to three Canadian soldiers, recently returned from Afghanistan: Jeff, Matt and Dave. All three speak candidly about the hell that now consumes their lives: flashbacks hurtling them back to the danger of the war zone, grief for dead comrades, their ongoing battles with addiction, even suicide attempts.\n\nPTSD is not a new phenomenon. In the First World War, it was called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshell shockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, never really understood, and never adequately dealt with. But, the urgency to find a treatment has never been greater. By the time CanadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s combat mission in Afghanistan is over in 2011, 35,000 Canadian men and women will have served there. Using the militaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own arguably conservative estimate, as many as 2,000 of those could be coming home with PTSD. \n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 349 MiB for 44mn 39s 579ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : HDTV\nLanguage          : English CA\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 952 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2217c29688c022425394ab9fb1dfc9ccbe684c5a","amp;dn":"CBC+the+fifth+estate-Broken+Heroes.S19E05.HDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2217c29688c022425394ab9fb1dfc9ccbe684c5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,23,194,150,136,192,34,66,83,148,171,159,177,223,201,204,190,104,76,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
