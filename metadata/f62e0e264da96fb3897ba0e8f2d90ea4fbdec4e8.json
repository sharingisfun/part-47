Nominations for writing in music/comedy program: Colbert Report, Daily Show, Conan, Letterman, Real Time with Bill Maher.\nAs usual the nomination clips are kind of little sketches made by the shows themselves.\nConan O&amp;#039;Brien wins and the writer who accepts is pretty funny so I kept that bit (unfortunately the first joke demands that you saw Katherine Heigl&amp;#039;s acceptance speach, where she said even her mother told her she wouldn&amp;#039;t win).\n\n2. Steve Carell presents award for music/comedy series (includes taped bit of Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer), and Jon Stewart accepts for The Daily show.\n\n3. Lewis Black does a rant slash standup routine.\n\n4. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert presents award for lead actor in comedy series.  Hilarious.  Steve Carell joins in.  Not to be missed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f62e0e264da96fb3897ba0e8f2d90ea4fbdec4e8","amp;dn":"Emmy+Awards+clips+%28Carell%2C+Stewart%2C+Colbert%2C+Black%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f62e0e264da96fb3897ba0e8f2d90ea4fbdec4e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,46,14,38,77,169,111,179,137,123,160,232,242,217,14,164,251,222,196,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
