Sean Pinchin has been performing for many years in many acts and this album shows you how he travelled from a 3 piece band ensemble to solo slide guitar and vocals. &quot;Folklore&quot; includes mostly original songs, plus four classic blues &quot;interpretations&quot;. All the music on this album has been arranged by Sean Pinchin. THIS CD WAS RECORDED LIVE WITH NO OVERDUBS, mostly in friends livingrooms, kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms. Since its release the album has sold very well locally at live performances and internationally via CD Baby. This album marks the beginning of what Sean would call his life's work.\n\n\nPlease visit the artists website to see more from him\n\nseanpinchin.ca\n\n\nSpread the music.\n\n\nPs. My favourite songs are Cardigans and not my baby.  The quality of the CD isn't the greatest just because its an Indie release, but it's still worth it.  \n\nI will seed for at least a few days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:700a37762dd187506736be60e3bb6daec9f34c2d","amp;dn":"Sean+Pinchin+-+Folklore+%28Amazing+canadian+indie+folk+slide+guita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"700a37762dd187506736be60e3bb6daec9f34c2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,10,55,118,45,209,135,80,103,54,190,96,227,187,109,174,201,243,76,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
