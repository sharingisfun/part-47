In this latest installment of the legendary RPG series, divine insurrection besieges the heavens. Invoking his power as king of the gods, Odin hastily reincarnates the spirit of rebel valkyrie Silmeria into Alicia, Princess of Dipan. However, unbeknownst to Odin, the spirit of the battle maiden awakens within Alicia, still seeking vengeance. Believing his daughter to be possessed, King Barbarossa of Dipan declares Alicia dead and exiles her to a faraway castle. Odin learns of Silmeria s awakening and dispatches the imperious Hrist Valkyrie to summon her spirit to Valhalla. Alicia runs in fear -- and Silmeria in defiance -- as they embark on a journey where nothing is what it seems and all hide behind a mask.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:323a8336e78cd389189b5b3aef1c22a46980b103","amp;dn":"Valkyrie+Profile+2+Silmeria+%5BPS2DVD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"323a8336e78cd389189b5b3aef1c22a46980b103","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,58,131,54,231,140,211,137,24,155,91,58,239,28,34,164,105,128,177,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
