(AMG)\n\n\n\nThis single disc, 15-track Grand Funk compilation contains just about every single hit that Mark Farner and company recorded out during their magical late-'60s/early-'70s run. \nAlthough they were never the critic's choice, Grand Funk became a &quot;people's band&quot; on the strength of such rock anthems as the epic &quot;Closer to Home/I'm Your Captain,&quot; &quot;We're an American Band,&quot; &quot;The Loco-Motion,&quot; and &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful,&quot; which are all included here. \nCAPITOL COLLECTORS SERIES serves as a solid, to-the-point overview of a band that, more than most, evokes the point when the '60s became the '70s.
