The documents will give people around the world an unprecedented insight into US Government foreign activities.\n\nThe cables, which date from 1966 up until the end of February this year, contain confidential communications between 274 embassies in countries throughout the world and the State Department in Washington DC. 15,652 of the cables are classified Secret.\n\nThe embassy cables will be released in stages over the next few months. The subject matter of these cables is of such importance, and the geographical spread so broad, that to do otherwise would not do this material justice.\n\nThe cables show the extent of US spying on its allies and the UN; turning a blind eye to corruption and human rights abuse in &quot;client states&quot;; backroom deals with supposedly neutral countries; lobbying for US corporations; and the measures US diplomats take to advance those who have access to them.\n\nThis document release reveals the contradictions between the USÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s public persona and what it says behind closed doors ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and shows that if citizens in a democracy want their governments to reflect their wishes, they should ask to see whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going on behind the scenes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:081c840bff9d78001cfa2954e886aba7dc821ccb","amp;dn":"Wikileaks+Cablegate+-+Website+Image+12.+3.+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"081c840bff9d78001cfa2954e886aba7dc821ccb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,28,132,11,255,157,120,0,28,250,41,84,232,134,171,167,220,130,28,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
