The throbbing The Real \n\nWorld; the utterly transcendent The Borderline (&quot;If we are like water then \n\nwhich drop is me&quot;) and the captivating If I Could See You.\n\nThink about that for a sec. Any singer/songwriter would readily revisit \n\nRobert's crossroads to sign a deal with the devil for an introductory salvo like \n\nthat. Add the extremely sad fact that most artists today won't have three killer \n\ntunes in a lifetime and you can see and hear how far ahead of the game you \n\nare with Stranger Place.\n\nThough it's easier here to spot her influences (Ani DiFranco, Sarah \n\nMcLachlan, Natalie Merchant) than on her equally fine and defining \n\nfollow-up Keep Walking, Maguire's striking, real world lyricism renders Sarah \n\nand Natalie mute, while her emotionally textured arrangementsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½brought to \n\nlife by bassist Christian Dunham and drummer Shane NesicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½never wander \n\ninto Ani-like self indulgence. Best listened to as a complete work of intelligent \n\npassion, other haunt-your-head tracks include Somebody, I Thought I Saw, \n\nLove Song and Stranger Place.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/11/emily-maguire/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/11/emily-maguire/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69fbc3c079ee19d51689f6018afbebbd7fe4af04","amp;dn":"Emily+Maguire...Stranger+Place%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69fbc3c079ee19d51689f6018afbebbd7fe4af04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,251,195,192,121,238,25,213,22,137,246,1,138,251,235,189,127,228,175,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
