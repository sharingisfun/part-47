In fact, Po's defining characteristic appears to be that he is the laziest of all the animals in ancient China. That's a problem because powerful enemies are at the gates, and all hopes have been pinned on a prophesy naming Po as the &quot;Chosen One&quot; to save the day. A group of martial arts masters are going to need a black belt in patience if they are going to turn this slacker panda into a kung fu fighter before it's too late.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b39174b56e29cf3d7f83760fbefe7222a7b8de8a","amp;dn":"Kung+Fu+Panda+%2ASouthernDownloads%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b39174b56e29cf3d7f83760fbefe7222a7b8de8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,145,116,181,110,41,207,61,127,131,118,15,190,254,114,34,167,184,222,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
