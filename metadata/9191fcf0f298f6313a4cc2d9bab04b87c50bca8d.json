Good stuff.  Certified clean of any &quot;nasties,&quot; at least by me (having originated the torrent).\n\nAll files are in .wav format.  I simply ripped the CD using Exact Audio Copy and simply put it into a ZIP file with no compression at all (used &quot;Store&quot; setting on WinRAR).  Better than FLAC!\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9191fcf0f298f6313a4cc2d9bab04b87c50bca8d","amp;dn":"FC%2FKahuna+-+Machine+Says+Yes+%28UK+Release+%2F+LOSSLESS+%2F+WAV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9191fcf0f298f6313a4cc2d9bab04b87c50bca8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,145,252,240,242,152,246,49,58,76,194,217,186,176,75,135,197,11,202,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
