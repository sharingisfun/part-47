This elaborately assembled film is the story of the events leading up to the dawn of the atomic age. Paul Newman plays General Leslie Groves, a hard-nosed career soldier who in 1942 finds himself the reluctant &quot;nursemaid&quot; to a group of idealistic scientists in Los Alamos, New Mexico. As the military head of the top-secret Manhattan Project, Groves intends to have the operation run by the book--and failing that, to have things his way at all costs. The film&amp;#039;s storyline narrows down to a battle of egos between Groves and atomic scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Dwight Schultz), in his own way as contentious and childishly single-purposed as the general.\n\n[b]Video:[/b] Pal Widescreen 2.35:1\n[b]Audio:[/b] DD 5.1 English, DD 2.0 Spanish\n[b]Subtitles:[/b] English, German, Arab, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Slovenian, Spanish, Finnish, French, Greek, Hebrew, Dutch, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Rumanian, Serbian, Swedish, Turkish.\n\n[b]Rippeo:[/b] DVD Remake, DVD Rebuilder + HC(2 pass)\n\n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 58,8%\n- Overall Bitrate : 4.213Kbs\n- Space for Video : 3.745.206KB\n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 4.320/3.815/4.213 Kbs\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d31a7dc98f348ee1555c0a08f020b9fb024ecfb0","amp;dn":"Fat+Man+%26+Little+Boy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d31a7dc98f348ee1555c0a08f020b9fb024ecfb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,26,125,201,143,52,142,225,85,92,10,8,240,32,185,251,2,78,207,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
