With Hardcore Pawn there are two such episodes. They were shown on 21 December 2009. They are absent from every torrent of HCP i have ever found. But they are listed on Wikipedia, IMDb, and similar sites. \n\nIf you are going through some HCP withdrawal here is a little tease that probably won't hold you over until season 6 but, hey, it's only 2 episodes. \n\nAfter some time on direct download i thought it time to bring them over here for those who prefer torrents. \n\n\nHardcore.Pawn.s00e01.Robo.Bites.HDTV.XviD-jAh.avi\nHardcore.Pawn.s00e02.Ashleys.Back.HDTV.XviD-jAh.avi\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21b19bac033cec107060da6c9ac6bbee8bb3629d","amp;dn":"Hardcore+Pawn+-+season+00+-+jAh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21b19bac033cec107060da6c9ac6bbee8bb3629d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,177,155,172,3,60,236,16,112,96,218,108,154,198,187,238,139,179,98,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
