It had a bad crop and flicker noise etc, but still nice:), well made a avs script with some filters in it....tweaked the RGB, slightly changed the saturation on the source, didn't seem to bad, added a deblock filter added a sharpness filter, and a smoothness, it made the video look pretty damn good.... it took just over 9hours to encode but well worth it...looks pretty sweet if you ask me:D Audio had a bad crackling noise, removed most of it as we could. Enjoy.\n\ncredit PrisM &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone, Dibya9999 &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2798a5c22e336375be385840d134a733b2f6f9a4","amp;dn":"Toy.Story.3.2010.TS.XviD-PrisM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2798a5c22e336375be385840d134a733b2f6f9a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,152,165,194,46,51,99,117,190,56,88,64,209,52,167,51,178,246,249,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
