Total playing time: 1:23:56\n\nWorks on most new DVD players (from the past 2 years)\n\nSequel to the Esoteric Agenda, this movie focuses on human and universal consciousness\nand points out psyche disease that mankind has induced that is creating insane illusion\nwhich is the main cause of pain and suffer. Goes deeper into metaphysical aspects and\nconnects ancient hidden myths and history with modern ways of society and political\noutcome. Explains shamanism, duality, and reality behind DNAs and modern false beliefs.\nOverall, Kymatica is another excellent movie which attempts to point out the fundamental\nmisconception that humankind are facing today that has resulted in imbalance between\nplanet, nature and species.\n\nFeaturing Dr. Bruce Lipton and Henrik Palmgren (Red Ice Creations)\n\nI included the intro to 'Making Love' a CD by Barry Long which consists of 4 audio (mp3) files\n\nI highly recommend the following documentaries:\n\nOne - The Movie\n\nAmerica: Freedom to Fascism by Aaron Russo\n\nWhat the Bleep Do We Know by Alexandra Bruce\n\nSecrets of the Mayan Calendar Revealed by Ian X. Lungold\n\nZeitgeist - The Movie &amp; Zeitgeist Addendum by Peter Joseph\n\nThe Secret by Rhonda Byrne\n\n\n  Spread the Love","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:362af1bb035fca757b21cfebb6701ea464f50761","amp;dn":"Kymatica+%282009%29+in+6+Parts+MPEG+-+Follow-Up+to+Esoteric+Agenda","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"362af1bb035fca757b21cfebb6701ea464f50761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,42,241,187,3,95,202,117,123,33,207,235,182,112,30,164,100,245,7,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
