The slow ballad &quot;Don't Close Your Eyes&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½containing anti-suicide lyricsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½led the way as their only Top 40 single (peaking at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100) and other popular cuts followed. The album featured the popular singles &quot;Cold Blood&quot; and &quot;Blow My Fuse&quot;, along with popular videos showing the band in concert at Hammerjack's. In 1989, the band released Blow My Fuse: The Videos, with their now-popular videos and behind-the-scenes footage. As Kix finally graduated to arenas, they opened for such popular artists as Aerosmith.\n\nKix took time out in late 1988 to visit Britain for a three-show trek, which included a gig at Birmingham's Edwards No 8 club, a support slot to Yngwie Malmsteen at the Dominion Theatre in London, and a headlining slot in the capital's legendary Marquee Club.\n\nReturning to the U.S., Ronnie &quot;10/10&quot; Younkins spent a period of time in rehab for a drug problem, but rejoined the group now sober in the new year. Kix successfully toured with RATT and Britny Fox in early 1989, allowed a step-up on the bill in a gentlemanly gesture by Britny Fox in Landover, Maryland. The band performed an absolute blinder in front of their adoring home-state audience.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4efb9b0d66d8a5e31538085d2add7ce1eca6b6a0","amp;dn":"Kix+-+Blow+My+Fuse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4efb9b0d66d8a5e31538085d2add7ce1eca6b6a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,251,155,13,102,216,165,227,21,56,8,93,42,221,124,225,236,166,182,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
