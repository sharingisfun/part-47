A \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;friend\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; gives him a dog named Jerry Lee, who has been trained to smell drugs. With his help, Dooley sets out to put his enemy behind the bars, but Jerry Lee has a personality of his own and works only when he wants to. On the other hand, the dog is quite good at destroying Dooley\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s car, house and sex-life... \n\nMike Dooley, who works on the San Diego narcotics squad, is working on a stakeout of drug kingpin Ken Lyman, and Mike barely escapes with his life as his car is blown up by a helicopter that was sent by Lyman.
