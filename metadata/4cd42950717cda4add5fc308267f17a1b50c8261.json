I hope to begin devoting my time to fighting for Liberty in a more direct way in the very near future.)\n\nBlair Holt was a 16-year old honor student in Chicago who was murdered in May, 2007 when another teenager began firing a handgun on a public bus in a gang-related attack. Acting heroically, Holt moved to shield a female rider from the bullets, and he was struck in the abdomen and died. I think itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a shame that such a heroic young man is being used as the namesake to such a terrible piece of anti-gun legislation. HR45 amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to prohibit a person from possessing a firearm unless that person has been issued a firearm license under this Act or a state system certified under this Act and such license has not been invalidated or revoked. In other words, if it has a trigger, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve gotta get government permission to own it.\n\nTodayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s callers: Quince/Pennsylvania; Dave/Michigan; Dan/COLUMBIA; Paul/California; Jim/Florida; Steve/Ohio; Kay/California;\nCarol Ann/Minnesota (who has been my loyal program coordinator for 14 months)\n(Many thanks to all my loyal listeners over the past two years!\nFeel free to send me an eMail if you have any questions about the Constitution.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cd42950717cda4add5fc308267f17a1b50c8261","amp;dn":"Lighting+the+Fires+of+Liberty+w%2F+Badnarik+20090320+Final+Show","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cd42950717cda4add5fc308267f17a1b50c8261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,212,41,80,113,124,218,74,221,95,195,8,38,127,23,161,181,12,130,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
