Unfortunately when two police officers come around  \n      to disturb this, a misunderstanding quickly becomes out of control, resulting Wally,\n      Beryl and her child being trapped in their house, surrounded by armed police under  \n      the impression that Wally is holding everyone hostage. Events quickly spiral into a \n      media circus as, through the siege, Wally - inadvertently - manages to become a     \n      symbol for the anti-war movement.                                                   \n   \n     Group Info  \n   \n      Our mission is to provide the scene with decent quality rips of old movie classics.\n   \n      Greets fly out to ARCHiViST, GERUDO, INQUISITION, RedBlade, REWARD, and everyone\n      that helped us; you know who you guys are!\n   \n      Looking for decent affil sites (no rented/colo) and rippers/cappers.\n   \n      Ask around for us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:354ee9025dddcd76309fd0517b6d431c950a7867","amp;dn":"My.Entire.Life.1996.DVDRip.x264-PHOBOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"354ee9025dddcd76309fd0517b6d431c950a7867","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,78,233,2,93,221,205,118,48,159,208,81,123,109,67,28,149,10,120,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
