Guitarist Philip Catherine and bassist Jean Louis Rassinfosse (both of whom had recorded with the trumpeter previously) are major assets to the subtle but swinging session. Each of the performances (Bob Zieff's &quot;Sad Walk,&quot; Horace Silver's &quot;Strollin',&quot; &quot;Love for Sale,&quot; &quot;But Not for Me,&quot; and a 15-minute version of Richard Beirach's &quot;Leaving&quot;) are extended versions but there are no rambling or wandering moments during this set of lyrical jazz. \n\nRecorded 21st June  1985 at the 7th Jazz Festival, Munster, Germany.\n\nChet Baker - Trumpet\nPhilip Catherine - Guitar\nJean-Louis Rassinfosse - Bass\n\n 1.
