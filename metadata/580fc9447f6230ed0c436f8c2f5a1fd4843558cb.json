Many fans consider this album the original turning point in their musical identity, distinguishing between the old and new Savatage.\n\nIt is their first album produced by Paul O'Neill, who was assigned to the band after their previous tour. As their first concept album, it has a constant tone (of darkness, in this case) and is more complex than their previous albums, with two entirely instrumental tracks that go beyond simple guitar riffs and solos, namely &quot;Prelude to Madness&quot; and &quot;Last Dawn&quot;.\n\n&quot;Prelude to Madness&quot; is an arrangement of Grieg's In the Hall of the Mountain King from the Peer Gynt suite. Oddly, Grieg is not credited for this song, but for the following title track - which ironically, is an original song.\n\nThrough Paul O'Neill's connections, he brought in Ray Gillen, of Badlands fame to perform a vocal duet at the end of &quot;Strange Wings&quot;.\n\nThis was the first album to feature the album cover drawn by artist Gary Smith, who was responsible for lead guitarist Criss Oliva's airbrushed guitars at the time.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:580fc9447f6230ed0c436f8c2f5a1fd4843558cb","amp;dn":"Savatage+-+Hall+Of+The+Mountain+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"580fc9447f6230ed0c436f8c2f5a1fd4843558cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,15,201,68,127,98,48,237,12,67,111,140,47,90,31,212,132,53,88,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
