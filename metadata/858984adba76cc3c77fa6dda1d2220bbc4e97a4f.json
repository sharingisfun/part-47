The series begins with a mass murder in the Saudi Arabian desert and climaxes at an environmental summit in Calgary where it focuses on backroom efforts to get the Americans to sign up to Kyoto 2 at a the climate change conference in Calgary. It boils down to a choice - either the oil-based economy goes to hell and makes the crash of 1929 seem like a slow Friday, or everything goes to hell and life on Earth ceases to exist. \nThis is a good drama with rich dialogue - it achieves what it sets out to do: present a story that engages and the viewer and delivers an important message.\n\n\nStarring: Marc Warren, Rupert Penry-Jones, Bradley Whitford, Neve Campbell\n\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1105836/\nIMDB Rating: 6.8/10  (141 votes)\nWhat: A political thriller/drama set in the real-life context of climate change\nWhere first seen: BBC 2\nWhen first seen: July 2008\nNumber of parts: Two\nDuration: 1 hour and 25 minutes each part(total viewing approximately 3 hours)\nLanguage: English\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:858984adba76cc3c77fa6dda1d2220bbc4e97a4f","amp;dn":"Burn+Up+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+TV+Movie.HDTV.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"858984adba76cc3c77fa6dda1d2220bbc4e97a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,137,132,173,186,118,204,60,119,250,109,218,29,34,32,187,196,233,122,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
