It was released as the fourth single from his fourth studio album, 808s &amp; Heartbreak. The song was co-produced with Jeff Bhasker and Plain Pat, while co-written by the three along with Consequence and Kid Cudi. The original version of the song, which appears on the album, features Mr Hudson, an artist signed to West's GOOD Music. A remix featuring Rihanna was recorded in the Fall of 2008 and was supposed to be sent to US radio on January 20, 2009 as the album's third single, however, the release was canceled. Eventually, the album version featuring Mr Hudson was sent to radio stations instead on March 24, 2009 as the album's fourth single, shortly after the release of the album's third single, &quot;Amazing&quot;. &quot;Amazing&quot; was sent for adds at Rhythmic/Urban radio only, while &quot;Paranoid&quot; was sent to Mainstream Top 40 radio.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Paranoid&quot; was directed by Nabil Elderkin and along with &quot;Amazing,&quot; filmed in Hawaii. During a brief interview at the Tribeca Film Festival, West revealed he had cast Superstar Rihanna as a lead in the video. West said the following about collaborating with Rihanna: &quot;Yep, she's my Paranoid girl in the video. SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an amazing talent though. Collaborating with her is always a pleasure!&quot; L.A. Reid premiered a version of the video during an Island Def Jam Event on May 20, 2009. The music video leaked online on May 27, 2009. The next day, West clarified on his blog that the video was an unfinished version and posted screenshots of the final version. In an interview that took place the following day, Elderkin stated that the leak was merely an early rough cut. In terms of visuals, Elderkin had originally wanted to design the video in an artistic style reminiscent to that of A Clockwork Orange, but West subsequently opted for an abstracted noir concept instead. The video's premise is rooted in fantasy, as it centers around Rihanna's paranoid state of mind causing her to experience a surrealistic dream sequence. On June 3, West released the finalized version of the music video on his blog, just hours after premiering a unreleased video for &quot;Spaceship.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73388d898501f4c7abeabbb449883a6075cca8d7","amp;dn":"Kanye+West+feat.+Mr.+Hudson+%26+Rihanna+-+Paranoid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73388d898501f4c7abeabbb449883a6075cca8d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,56,141,137,133,1,244,199,171,234,187,180,73,136,58,96,117,204,168,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
