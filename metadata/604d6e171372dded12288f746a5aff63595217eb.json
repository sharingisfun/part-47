Gamera - The Giant Monster is \nstructured much like the first Godzilla. The Cold War heats \nup near the North Pole and when a Soviet MIG fighter is shot \ndown, its nuclear payload spectacularly explodes, unleashing \nthe frozen-in-time Gamera. As the monster makes the usual \nbeeline to Tokyo, scientists and the military can find no way \nto stop the creature. A subplot introduces lonely, motherless \nToshio (Yoshiro Uchida), whose torturous conflicts at home over \na pet turtle lead to the boy's complete and dangerous obsession \nwith the destructive monster.\n\nThe first Gamera movie isn't as enjoyable as those that followed, \npartly because it's less original, following Godzilla's \nwell-trodden path of destruction so closely, and because the \nsubplot with Toshio is more irritating than affective. In its \noriginal Japanese version, it's clear the boy is basically \npathetic and delusional, and the approach is uniquely Japanese \nin a manner that doesn't play well at all to American viewers.\n\n------------- Film Trailer -------------\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBut it did lay the foundation for the series' lasting impact. By \n1965 Toho's monster movies were already in decline, shifting away \nfrom the mainstream appeal they once enjoyed toward an audience of \nprimarily teenagers and, later still, children. Gamera director \nNoriaki Yuasa and screenwriter Niisan Takahashi wholeheartedly \nembraced this trend rather than fight it. By the third entry, \nchildren became the central characters and the movies were told \nfrom their innocent perspectives rather than neutral adult ones. \nRarely do movies do this, even children's films about children - a \nfew exceptions to this rule are The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T, Invaders \nfrom Mars (both 1953) and The Railway Children (1971). Takahashi and \nYuasa clearly empathized with these characters and, certainly in Mr. \nYuasa's case, retained a childlike sense of wonder apparent in their \nwork.\n\nInstead, the first Gamera movie is interesting in other ways. It was \nthe only series entry in black and white, giving it a unique look that \nalso helps hide some of its deficiencies in terms of the visual effects. \nBut even these are often good and always inventive. Where Toho was by \nthe mid-'60s scaling back on its effects, and where rivals like Toei, \nNikkatsu, and Shochiku would cut corners and/or show limited imagination \non its eventual kaiju eiga, Daiei's early Gamera films had an original \nlook and the obvious effort is there onscreen.\n\n----------------- SCREENCAPS ---------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37487.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37487.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37488.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37488.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37489.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37489.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37490.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37490.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37491.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/38000/photo-37491.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n   General\n   \n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 18mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 994 Kbps\n      Writing library : VirtualDub-MPEG2 build 24586/release\n      \n   Video \n   \n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : DX50\n      Codec ID/Hint : DivX 5\n      Duration : 1h 18mn\n      Bit rate : 1 857 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 304 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.35:1\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.362\n      Stream size : 1.02 GiB (93%)\n      Writing library : DivX 6.8.4\n      \n   Audio \n   \n      Language : Japanese\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 18mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 71.9 MiB (6%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.98.4\n      \n   Source\n\n      Region One DVD(NTSC) 720 x 480 29.970 fps 2.35:1\n      B&amp;W AC3 Dolby 2CH Stereo 192 Kb/s 48.0 KHz\n\n\n   Encode Note\n\n      Production &amp; Distribution Logo's have been removed due to\n      video size constraints.
