Their majesty and mystery lead the film to a most unexpected and haunting finale which considers the future of our relationship to technology and Nature, in an increasingly artificial or &quot;virtual&quot; world...\n\n\n IMDb.............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110831\n Year.............: 1994\n Country..........: Canada  | Switzerland\n Runtime..........: 83Minutes\n Audio............: ENGLISH: Dolby Digital Stereo\n Subtitles........: French, German (Sub+idx)\n\n&quot;The result of MettlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s struggle with the elements is PICTURE OF LIGHT.

Hypnotic displays  of the aurora borealis...are the gold at the end of MettlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rainbow, but getting there is more than half the fun. The film is an existential meditation on snow and space and cold, undercut by an absurdist wit... Mettler goes to a world where cameras freeze and tries to film nothingness, unbroken patterns of land and sky. He achieves amazing results. In the context of Canadian cinema, where characters often live in uneasy tension with their environment, for once there is no contest: the weather wins, hands down.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Brian D.

Johnson, MACLEANÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S MAGAZINE\n\n&quot;...you sense you're watching a new art form in the process of creation...among the very best documentaries to come along in years...PICTURE OF LIGHT is an elegantly framed lyric by Peter Mettler about the North and the northern lights. At the very outset, the director hints there's deeper music to be heard here by introducing us to a camera designed especially for the deep cold. Spurred on by thoughts of a man he met at a part &quot;who watches the shy&quot;, Mettler's PICTURE OF LIGHT is as much a meditation on documentary filmmaking as it is on the North.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Peter Goddard, THE TORONTO STAR\n\n&quot;PICTURE OF LIGHT is the most beautiful fusion of art and science I've seen since Michael Snow's La RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gion Centrale&quot;.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Jonathan Rosenbaum, CHICAGO READER critic\n\n&quot;PICTURE OF LIGHT confronts the ontological status of film, brandishing profundity, humour and many extraordinarily beautiful images, concluding finally that film's relationship to reality and experience is, in the best cases, rather like all of life's Big Questions -- puzzling, troubling, awe-inspiring.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Peter Urquhart, REVERSE SHOT\n\n&quot;Personal, quirky, inquisitive and visually sophisticated, PICTURE OF LIGHT is Canadian writer/director Peter Mettler's investigative meditation on the aurora borealis -- the northern lights.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ David Armstrong, SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER\n\n&quot;With his masterful new film about the aurora borealis, PICTURE OF LIGHT,  a breathtaking investigation of the powers and limits of film language, Mettler should assume his rightful, prominent place in contemporary Canadian cinema...From its title onward, PICTURE OF LIGHT articulates the paradox of the extraordinary film unspooling before us. In a voice over that at once affirms and questions its authoritative role in the documentary tradition, Mettler reminds us that his tools are inadequate and falsifying. We know he is right. We also know, as he does, that these picture of light, these simulacra, do inspire wonder, do remind us that for all our scientific marvels and technological advances, we remain unfinished and searching. In its meditative, marvelous simplicity, PICTURE OF LIGHT unmasks its frames, and demands that we look beyond them.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Tom McSorley, TAKE ONE\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMettler is slowly but surely affirming his presence as one of the most original cineastes of his generation.
