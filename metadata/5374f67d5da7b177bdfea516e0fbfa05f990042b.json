The title should generally reflect our approach and reflection in a social-network and mobile-gadgetry driven society. BUILD refers to the DIY attitude we exercise when dealing with latest hardware tools and devices, but also applying and re-arranging old ideas and recycling junk-hardware into a new setup. BREAKing is the liberation of imaginative thoughts through action; cracking black boxes and escaping the paved routes of top-down systems.Last but not least, BROADCAST is referring to a technique of finding appropriate media channels for your work by all kind of means, from setting up hidden network video stream to social engineering or placing stickers algorithmically around the city.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5374f67d5da7b177bdfea516e0fbfa05f990042b","amp;dn":"MDMA-PZI-09-BBB-MOODR_HANDBOOK-%5BPDF%5D.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5374f67d5da7b177bdfea516e0fbfa05f990042b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,116,246,125,93,167,177,119,189,254,165,22,224,251,250,5,249,144,4,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
