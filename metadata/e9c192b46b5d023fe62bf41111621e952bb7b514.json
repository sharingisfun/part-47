(I even edited clips together; for instance, when a really good quality video had the beginning cut off, I edited in the missing footage from another video shot by someone else.)\n\nI also made a photo gallery slideshow. I am really proud of and happy with the results of my work (which took a long time as I am an amateur at this) and I would love to share this with the other fans!\n\nAbout the gig: Radiohead took a stand in their unique way to try and help Haiti, playing one show at one of the finest venues in Los Angeles, The Henry Fonda Theater (often referred to as the Music Box). The band put every ticket of the show up for auction on Ticketmaster. Needless to say, every ticket was purchased, the lowest winning bid? $475.00. What was the highest any fan paid to see the show? Just over $2,000.00. Radiohead opted to have 100% of the gross go to Oxfam, a non-profit concern that was already in Haiti before the earthquake struck.\n\nVideo editing and DVD authoring by inkybrown &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.soledadmiranda.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.soledadmiranda.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you enjoy this, please seed for other fans.\n\n01.
