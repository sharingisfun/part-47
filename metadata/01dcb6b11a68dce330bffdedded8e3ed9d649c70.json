The installed components of this release include shortcuts to allow you to change the system's default player from the 32bit to 64bit player.\n\n\nObservation noted\n\nOne other aspect of Windows Media Player(s) on x64 systems needs to be mentioned. If you associate a particular filetype to open with WMP while the system default is set to use the 64bit player, that filetype will always open the 64bit player when double-clicked. This occurs even if you change the system default back to using the 32bit player. \n\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\n- update ffdshow rev 2719\n\n- update Gabest to rev 1004\n\n- fix memory leak in DXVA codec\n\n- minor changes to default settings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01dcb6b11a68dce330bffdedded8e3ed9d649c70","amp;dn":"Win7x64+Components+1.0.4+%28Win7codecs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01dcb6b11a68dce330bffdedded8e3ed9d649c70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,220,182,177,26,104,220,227,48,191,253,237,222,216,227,237,157,100,156,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
