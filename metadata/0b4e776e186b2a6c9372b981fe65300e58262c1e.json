It was distributed by Moribund Cult records who have supported the band since the beginning. They soon changed their name to Drawn and Quartered. After that Kelly used the name Plague Bearer as a continuation of his project.\n\nMatt Cason was the bands drummer up to 2002 when the band mutually agreed he should join Serpens Aeon full time.\n\nMembers of Drawn and Quartered are in side projects called Winds of Pestilence, and Plague Bearer\n\n\n\nQuote from Herb/Vocalist\nAbout this release:\n  &quot;Crusaders Of Blasphemy&quot; was recorded largely just for promotion, \n   and really more so for Moribund. We recorded it in our rehearsal space \n   on an 8-track, and as we were fairly satisfied with the end result, \n   we did press up a limited number of copies, to get our name back out \n   in circulation.  \n\n  Unfortunately there was a problem with the pressing, so we just \n   ended up giving most of the copies away at a couple of shows. \n  The good news is that &quot;CrusadersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦&quot; is getting an official release as we speak! \n   It is being issued on cassette, along with two additional tracks, \n   &amp;#039;Bloodbath Communion&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Slaughter The Disciples&amp;#039; \n   (which we recorded for a split 7-inch release that fell through) \n    by Ancient Spirit Terror Productions out of DeutschlandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ hail to them!&quot;\n\n\n\nDetailed Interview &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/drawnandquartered.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/drawnandquartered.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRipped by Big Brother\nFirst posted on www.thepiratebay.se\n\nTeam 1984 \nYour best source for:\n    Rare/Out of Print music\n    Audio/Video Bootlegs\n    Old/Out of Print Software\n    Counter-culture books/text\n    Off the beaten path movies\n    Weird Porn\n    Anything else that we dig..\n\nTeam 1984 doesn&amp;#039;t do mainstream\n          doesn&amp;#039;t follow the herd\n          are just some stoned hippies\n                     with attitude\n\nWant to be a member of Team 1984?\nSimple, \n    Just include this NFO\n             and\n    Don&amp;#039;t up anything lame/mainstream\n\nHails to:\n   freakyflicks, Fat Fuck Frank, sickboy88\n   splattergod, ChrisGoes, Bob Dylan\n\nFuck Off to:\n    RIAA, MPAA, Viacom, Metallica\n              ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b4e776e186b2a6c9372b981fe65300e58262c1e","amp;dn":"Drawn+and+Quartered+Crusaders+Of+Blasphemy+EP+death+metal+bolt+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b4e776e186b2a6c9372b981fe65300e58262c1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,78,119,110,24,107,42,108,147,114,185,129,254,101,48,14,88,38,44,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
