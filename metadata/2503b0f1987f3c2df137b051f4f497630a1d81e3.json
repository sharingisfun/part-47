Once again they start over with issue #1. Do you get tired of that?\nOnce again the Justice League breaks up in the end (ok it hasn&amp;#039;t happened. but it&amp;#039;s inevitable, we just don&amp;#039;t know when - maybe Final Crisi? Oh yea it will be the FINAL crisis. Next one will be &quot;Catastrophe on Trans-finite Earths or something. And Bruce Wayne will stay dead if they kill him. Very few besides Gwen Stacy and Luthien Tinuveil (Tolkien) have &quot;died indeed and left the world, and they have lost her whom they most loved.&quot; .:P\n\nTo repeat myself  - They just do this to manipulate you you know. :grrr: They want you to think &quot;Oh wow issue #1 - collectors item!&quot; I can get a complete run too! It&amp;#039;s a cheap trick! Don&amp;#039;t go along with it.
