For five decades, he has been one of the most successful small-group leaders in jazz\n\n\n\nTrack Listing: CD1: Autumn Rain; Blue Moon; The Gypsy; Invitation; I Remember Italy; Laura; Morning Mist; This is the Life. CD2: Exatogi; Masara; Trouble in Mind; Brother Hold Your Light; Blue Moon (reprise); Poinciana.\n\nPersonnel: Ahmad Jamal: piano; Reginald Veal: double bass; Herlin Riley: drums; Yusef Lateef: tenor saxophone, flute, vocals.\n\nRecord Label: Jazz Village\n\nThe ways the former chart-topping pianist Ahmad Jamal develops variations on a song stick closely to a trusted and popular script: start with a catchy unrelated hook, slip the tune in stealthily, jam on it, swap licks with the drummers, come back to the hook. That script regularly surfaces on this set, which devotes a disc to each half of the octogenarian's 2012 L'Olympia concert, plus a complete video DVD. The first set features the current Jamal quartet on originals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like the dreamy I Remember Italy and standards including a discreetly romantic Laura Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a dynamically funky This Is the Life, full of spirited exchanges with percussionist Manolo Badrena. The second half introduces pioneering world-jazz reeds-player Yusef Lateef, 18 months before his death, and respect for the honoured guest is palpable on the less coquettish character of the grooves. Lateef adds divertingly grumpy tenor-sax blurts and slithers to the quirky Exatogi, and quavery flute to the riffy Masara. But it's his passionate, yodelly vocal implorings and abstract flute effects on the gospel-steeped Brother Hold Your Light that gives this set a special character, less urbane than usual for Jamal. His 1950s pop hit Poinciana makes an obligatory, and rapturously received, appearance at the end","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4717199766a87bc2e80d689015bac8d228e1f26","amp;dn":"Ahmad+Jamal-+Live+at+the+Olympia%3A+June+27%2C+2012+%5BJazz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4717199766a87bc2e80d689015bac8d228e1f26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,113,113,153,118,106,135,188,46,128,214,137,1,91,172,141,34,142,31,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
