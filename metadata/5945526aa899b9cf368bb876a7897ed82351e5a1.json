With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon \nand District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal \norganizations that plague the city streets. The partnership proves to be effective, \nbut they soon find themselves prey to a reign of chaos unleashed by a rising criminal \nmastermind known to the terrified citizens of Gotham as The Joker.\n\nWith just one year having passed after taking out Ra's Al Ghul's plan to have Gotham \neliminated and the mysterious disappearance of Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA the Scarecrow, \nand after the city was nearly plundered with his toxins, Bruce Wayne and his vigilante \nalter-ego the Batman, continue the seemingly endless effort to bring order to Gotham, \nwith the help of Lt. James Gordon and newly appointed District Attorney Harvey Dent. \nBut a new threat has now emerged into the streets. The Dark Knight faces a rising \npsychopathic criminal called The Joker, whose eerie grin, laughter, and inhuman morality \nmakes him as dangerous than what he has yet to unleash. It becomes an agenda to Batman to \nstop the mysterious Joker at all costs, knowing that both of them are in an opposite \nline. One has no method at all and seeks to see the world plunge into the fire he has \nyet to light. One represents the symbol of hope and uses his own shadow to bring the \npeace and order he has yet to accomplish doing.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5945526aa899b9cf368bb876a7897ed82351e5a1","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Knight%5B2008%5D%C3%82%C2%A9+--PDR--","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5945526aa899b9cf368bb876a7897ed82351e5a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,69,82,106,168,153,185,207,54,139,184,118,167,137,126,216,35,81,229,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
