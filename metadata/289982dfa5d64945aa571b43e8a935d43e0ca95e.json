Survival depends on you,      \n         your magic and your sword.  What  sets  Legends  of      \n         Dawn apart, is the freedom  of  play  expressed  in      \n         several key attributes  that  are  rarely  seen  in      \n         typical RPG genres. We have poured our passion  and      \n         creativity into taking you on an  enthralling  ride      \n         away from wearisome reality, by providing you  with      \n         the choice to be whatever your  heart  desires,  in      \n         Legends of Dawn.                                         \n                                                                  \n         Of course, the choices you make  during  game  play      \n         does not prevent you  from  trying  something  else      \n         later, or simultaneously if  you  wish.  You  could      \n         combine the sword and  the  magic,  be  a  powerful      \n         crafter  or  anything   else.   Legends   of   Dawn      \n         liberates  from  class  restrictions  unlike   real      \n         life. Class, race and differences exist within  the      \n         game but after choosing your own race  and  gender,      \n         all else can  be  altered  without  restarting  the      \n         game.                                                    \n                                                                  \n         Another  quality  that  makes   Legends   of   Dawn      \n         interesting,  is  the  freedom  of  direction   and      \n         movement. Most games force a player to  follow  the      \n         main  storyline  and  forbid  any   deviation,   or      \n         significant veering off  the  set  course.  Legends      \n         of Dawn is more sympathetic to your playing  needs.      \n         You are free to wander wherever tickles your  fancy      \n         within the continent,  without  limitations,  under      \n         one condition. Stay alive. We have been careful  to      \n         ensure that the quests only  suggest,  rather  than      \n         impose direction of movement. Your  journey  is  in      \n         your hands alone.                                        \n                                                                  \n         In  addition  to  all  those  remarkable   features      \n         already mentioned, you are bound to notice  another      \n         cool thing about Legends of Dawn.  The  absence  of      \n         loading screen. It would have been so  much  easier      \n         to create a game that would constantly force you to      \n         wait before the screen while new contents load, but      \n         Dreamatrix is aware that your time is too  valuable      \n         to waste. We put our heads together and created our      \n         very own engine that discreetly streams content  in      \n         the background, in real time. You are free to enter      \n         houses, caves, dungeons, temples, new  regions  and      \n         so much more, without those pesky  loading  screens      \n         interrupting your playing pleasure.                      \n                                                                  \n         In order to provide you with such blissful range of      \n         possibilities, we had  to  create  a  rather  large      \n         world called Narr. The world of Narr in Legends  of      \n         Dawn,  spans  across  continents  through  stunning      \n         picturesque landscape  that  stimulates  the  mind.      \n         There are magical regions where the  mountains  and      \n         hills defy gravity, buoyant as  balloons.  We  have      \n         also created countless dungeons awaiting for you to      \n         discover  what  mysteries  lie  within  their  cold      \n         depths, as well as camps, impressive docks and grim      \n         fortresses that bear  silent  witness  to  battles.      \n         Mausoleums   and   cemeteries   also   await   your      \n         exploration. The hikes over  unforgiving  mountains      \n         and canyons are sure  to  thrill  the  most  ardent      \n         explorer.  Graceful  flying  islands  and  mystical      \n         swamps instil a sense of awe that could  nudge  you      \n         to cross the threshold of the  serene  temples  and      \n         shrines to pay your respects to  the  gods  of  the      \n         land. With so much more on offer than is  mentioned      \n         here, there is no reason why Legends of Dawn should      \n         not become your favourite RPG.                           \n\n         1- Unpack, burn or mount  \n         2- Install the game                                      \n         3- Copy the cracked content from PROPHET dir to          \n            &lt;installdir&gt;system folder                            \n         4- Go To Hell!                                           \n                                                                  \n         NOTE:                                                    \n         The game is updated to newest version - v1.07s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:289982dfa5d64945aa571b43e8a935d43e0ca95e","amp;dn":"Legends.of.Dawn.MULTi5-PROPHET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"289982dfa5d64945aa571b43e8a935d43e0ca95e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,153,130,223,165,214,73,69,170,87,27,67,232,169,53,212,62,12,169,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
