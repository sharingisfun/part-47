The Host Protection module proactively monitors for and blocks sophisticated hacking techniques used to compromise or steal data. By analyzing threats and displaying actionable alerts, Host Protection blocks zero-day attacks and other unauthorized activities, providing advanced protection against botnets, rootkits and inadvertent data disclosure.\n\n      New! This latest version extends the range of monitored events and operations for even greater and more customizable protection. Outpost excels in all currently-known leaktests, with additional focus on keylogger-like activities.\n    * Self-protection\n      Today's malware frequently seeks to shut down security software to make its own infection process easier. By incorporating solid tamper-proof protection for all its components, Outpost Firewall Pro makes it impossible for anyone except the authorized user of the program to disable or close active protection.\n\nAnti-spyware\n\n    * Essential spyware protection\n      Outpost's Anti-Spyware module safeguards PCs against the threat of spyware, which can range from displaying annoying ads to hijacking your browser homepage to stealing your identity and confidential data. Spyware is blocked at every possible stage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ installation, activation, transmission of information and re-installation. The on-demand scanner scours the system for traces of deactivated spyware and erases them completely.\n\nNetwork Security &amp; Continuity\n\n    * Connection security\n      The two-way firewall monitors your computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inbound and outbound connections and prevents local and remote unauthorized network access. It conceals access ports, making your presence on the Internet invisible. The Ethernet Protection module guards your network connections and prevents insider attacks by controlling the transmission of data over the network. This eliminates the potential risk for data such as chat windows or authenticated browser sessions to be delivered to the wrong destination or intercepted while in transit.\n\n    * Application access control\n      The firewall controls which programs are allowed to access the Internet, proactively protecting your PC against both zero-day threats and malware attempts to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œphone homeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\n    * Comprehensive coverage\n      Outpost Firewall Pro secures all types of connections (Ethernet, WiFi, DSL, cable, cellular, and dial-up), automatically applying the necessary security settings when the computer is connected to a new provider.\n\n    * Intrusion protection\n      The Attack Detection module automatically blocks known types of hacker attacks from entering your computer.\n\nPrivacy &amp; Web Safety\n\n    * Unsafe web site access restriction\n      Outpost Firewall Pro can optionally alert and block access to potentially malicious or unwanted web sites based on a predefined list of URLs. This filtering ensures you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t become a victim of inadvertent drive-by malware infection or phishing attacks that are looking to steal your passwords, login information and other sensitive data. The list of blocked sites is updated via the automatic anti-spyware updates and can be edited to reflect your preferences.\n\n    * IP Blocklist keeps surfing clean\n      Based on the BlockPost plug-in in earlier Outpost versions, the integrated IP Blocklist lets users restrict access to specified Internet domains. A valuable tool for both sensitive individuals and concerned parents, IP Blocklist will deny incoming/outgoing connectivity to ill-intent Internet zones, such as those distributing spyware or delivering obnoxious ads and graphics spam. The blocked entries can either be manually defined or imported as an aggregated list from community-maintained sources.\n\n    * Safe repository for personal data\n      Any confidential information ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ for example, bank account numbers and passwords ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that you define using ID Block is blocked from leaving the confines of your PC through communication channels such as IM, web or email. ID Block protects you against identity theft and phishing attacks that target personal confidential information. Plus, it ensures that no-one else ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including other members of your household - can accidentally or deliberately disclose this information on the web.\n\n    * Ad-free, anonymous surfing\n      By managing cookies and external referral URLs, Outpost lets you maintain a high level of privacy when visiting shopping, entertainment or news sites while at the same time allowing trusted sites to collect only the information needed to personalize pages for you. Additionally, Outpost Firewall Pro lets you limit the elements displayed on web pages, providing cleaner and faster browsing. You can even define which sites are permitted/not permitted to display images, rotate advertising banners, execute external code such as ActiveX or Java scripts, or deliver pop-ups. The latest version of Outpost ensures compatibility with even the most complex and sophisticated websites, delivering smooth performance and heightened online safety.\n\nTracking &amp; Control\n\n    * Network activity monitoring\n      Outpost's Network Activity Monitor shows every connection your PC makes with other computers on the Internet or local network, so you can see what's happening on your PC at all times and quickly close down any unauthorized connections.\n\n      New! In the new 2009 version, connections can be grouped/ungrouped according to application, and you can quickly edit any existing rules right from the interface.\n    * Password-protection, multiple configuration profiles\n      You can set passwords to protect your configuration from accidental or deliberate modification, as well as create and use multiple configuration profiles to suit your current risk exposure. For advanced users, the ability to construct multiple restore points through the save/load configuration command is a big plus.\n\n    * Better manageable events logs\n      OutpostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s old Log Viewer showed the history of past events on a computer.\n\n      New! The new version improves on the Log ViewerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clarity and manageability, adding support for per-category listings that can be sorted and filtered according to different user-specified criteria.\n\nCompatibility\n\n    * IPv6 support\n      The new network connection protocol extensively used in Windows Vista, IPv6, is fully recognized, filtered and its data protected. The protocol is the evolution of its predecessor, IPv4, and provides a number of scalability, automation and security improvements.\n\n    * New! Driver certification and latest Windows platforms compatibility\n      Outpost has received WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs) certification, meaning that its protection complies with MicrosoftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stringent quality, compatibility and stability requirements.\n\n    * Adaptive firewall rules\n      When traveling with your laptop, or changing ISP, you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to manually adjust your security for new connection settings - Outpost handles it automatically by designating connection-specific parameters such as DNS or gateway server addresses as environment variables.\n\n    * Entertainment mode for uninterrupted gameplay and video viewing\n      While you play full-screen games or watch videos on your PC, Outpost's Entertainment Mode ensures the program won't interrupt you with alerts if it detects new activity. New activity notifications are handled in the background without sacrificing current protection levels. You can customize which applications will automatically trigger the switch to Entertainment Mode.\n\nConvenience and Ease of Use\n\n    * Auto-learning mode\n      When Outpost is first started, it runs in a special ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlearning modeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ where all alert notifications are suppressed. During this time, the program is silently learning your typical program activity and firewall-monitored connections. After the learning period is over, Outpost reverts to normal mode and will prompt for a response only when new activity is seen, dramatically reducing the number of alerts requiring your involvement.\n\n    * Automatic configuration\n      Rules for most programs that access the Internet are applied automatically, relieving you of the need to enter rules manually every time a new application accesses the Internet or interacts with another program. This means that for most of the time, you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to deal with questions relating to Internet access, minimizing interruptions and minimizing risk exposure due to insecure configurations. Outpost includes a wide range of predefined access policies; these settings can be customized to your individual requirements at any time.\n\n    * ImproveNet delivers more ready-made configurations\n      ImproveNet is a voluntary system of program configuration aggregation and distribution. After being reviewed and approved by Agnitum engineers, rulesets submitted by Outpost users are distributed across the user base, providing you with the most secure and up-to-date rules for a wide range of activities and applications.\n\n    * SmartAdvisor - instant, context-sensitive help\n      If ImproveNet doesn't have the answer, SmartAdvisor is always on hand to help you make the right decision when configuring access information for an application.\n\n    * Hands-free updates\n      Whenever an update to Outpost Firewall Pro is released during your license period, the update module automatically retrieves the latest version from the Agnitum server and applies it as soon as you authorize it to do so.\n\n    * Analysis of digital signatures\n      The new method of application identification reduces the number of dialog windows users get. Thanks to the implementation of vendorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ digital certificates validation for Internet-active applications, qualifying programs are automatically assigned internet and local interaction permissions without asking a user. Digital certificates complement the existing practice of SHA-256 and MD5 checkups.\n\n\nOutpost Firewall Pro 2009\n\nEnglish / Deutsch / Francaise / Spanish /\nRussian Version\nSize: 26.8 MB\n\tdownload Outpost Firewall Pro\n\tEnglish / Deutsch / Francaise /\nSpanish / Russian x64 Version\nSize: 32.9 MB\tdownload Outpost Firewall Pro\nSystem Requirements\n\nSupported platforms: 32- and 64-bit Windows (Vista, WIndows XP, Windows Server 2003, 2008), Windows 2000 (SP3 and above), Windows 7 (beta support).\nHardware: 450 MHz or faster CPU(x86-/x64-/multi-core), 256Mb RAM, 100MB free disk space. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d1c491e7169db5792a962cd2372c31f81c64036","amp;dn":"%2832-bit%29Outpost+Firewall+Pro+2009%28latest%29-lifetime+serial+incl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d1c491e7169db5792a962cd2372c31f81c64036","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,28,73,30,113,105,219,87,146,169,98,205,35,114,195,31,129,198,64,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
