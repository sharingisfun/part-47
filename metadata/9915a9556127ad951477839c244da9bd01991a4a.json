Now we crack cryptsp.dll.\n\nThis is cracked version of cryptsp.dll. Applied crack allows using custom CSP\ndll not signed by Microsoft. Also, you will need to replace manifest associated\nwith cryptsp.dll. If you wish to manually change the original manifest instead\nof, copying this one, change only SHA-256 hash in manifest.\n\nThe SHA-256 hash of the patched dll is in BASE64 encoding. To create manually\nSHA-256:\n\nopenssl dgst -sha256 -binary &quot;C:cryptsp.dll.cracked&quot; | openssl enc -base64\n-out &quot;C:digest_b64_encoding.txt&quot;\n\nC:digest_b64_encoding.txt will now contain SHA-256 hash for manifest.\n\nIf you would like to patch cryptcsp.dll manually:\nDLL version must be 6.1.7600.16385 (Tested on Windows 7 Ultimate x86)\n\nAt offset 0x3CF4 change 0F 85 -&gt; 90 E9\n\n\nTobia Quantrill","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9915a9556127ad951477839c244da9bd01991a4a","amp;dn":"CryptSP.dll+crack+for+Windows+7+%28x86%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9915a9556127ad951477839c244da9bd01991a4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,21,169,85,97,39,173,149,20,119,131,156,36,77,169,189,1,153,26,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
