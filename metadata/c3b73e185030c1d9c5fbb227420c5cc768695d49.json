Virgin flew the band to New York for initial recordings of the album, then to Australia to shoot videos. The unknown band shot to #1 in the U.S., Canada and Norway with their debut single, &quot;(I Just) Died in Your Arms&quot;. Their most popular single, it was a multiformat success in the U.S., where it also reached number four on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, #24 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in an extended remix versionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ #37 on the Hot Dance/Club Play chart. The song peaked at #4 in the UK Singles Chart, as well as in Switzerland and South Africa; it went to #2 in Sweden and #9 in Austria.\n\nThe choice for follow-up single in the UK had been &quot;I've Been In Love Before&quot;, but that song only spent three weeks in the UK Top 40, peaking at #31. Their choice for follow-up single in the U.S. was their third UK release, &quot;One For The Mockingbird&quot;, but the song was a relative commercial disappointment on both sides of the Atlantic, just cracking the Top 40 of the Hot 100 at #38 and hitting #29 on the Mainstream Rock chart in the U.S., #47 in Canada and #52 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe band took a chance on &quot;I've Been in Love Before&quot; again, this time with greater success. The song became Cutting Crew's second U.S. Top 10 on the Hot 100, peaking at #9, and was their first major hit on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart, where it peaked at #4. This success prompted a UK re-release, and this time it spent five weeks in the UK Singles Chart Top 40, peaking at #24. The song failed to chart throughout most of Europe, but it peaked at #8 in Canada. Despite an unflattering review by Rolling Stone magazine, the band received a Grammy nomination as the Best New Artist of 1987.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b73e185030c1d9c5fbb227420c5cc768695d49","amp;dn":"Cutting+Crew+-+I%5C%27ve+Been+In+Love+Before","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b73e185030c1d9c5fbb227420c5cc768695d49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,183,62,24,80,48,193,217,197,251,178,39,66,12,92,199,104,105,93,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
