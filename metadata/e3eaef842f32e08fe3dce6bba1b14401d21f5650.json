Presumed dead for four years, he reappears from the desert on the Mexico border, world-weary and an amnesiac.\nHe traces his brother Walt who is bringing up Hunter, his seven-year-old son, his ex-wife Jane having abandoned him at Walt&amp;#039;s door several years before.\n\nAs virtual strangers, Hunter and Travis begin to build a wary friendship and conspire to find Jane and bring her back to be a real family. \n\nWith extraordinary performances from Harry Dean Stanton as Travis and Natassja Kinski as Jane, the film also boasts a soundtrack by Ry Cooder, ideally suited to the film&amp;#039;s sun-bleached landscapes and melancholy undertones. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wim-wenders.com/movies/movies_spec/paristexas/paris_texas.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wim-wenders.com/movies/movies_spec/paristexas/paris_texas.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease continue to seed after downloading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3eaef842f32e08fe3dce6bba1b14401d21f5650","amp;dn":"Paris%2C+Texas+%5B1984%5D+Wim+Wenders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3eaef842f32e08fe3dce6bba1b14401d21f5650","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,234,239,132,47,50,224,143,227,220,230,187,161,177,68,1,210,31,86,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
