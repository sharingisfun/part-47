The only threat mastermind thief Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) never saw coming was a member of his own crew. After pulling off an amazing gold bullion heist from a heavily guarded palazzo in Venice, Italy, Charlie and his gang -- inside man Steve (Norton), computer genius Lyle (Green), wheelman handsome Rob (Statham), explosives expert Left-Ear (Mos Def) and veteran safecracker John Bridger (Sutherland) - can&amp;#039;t believe when one of them turns out to be a double-crosser. Enter Stella (Theron), a beautiful nerves-of-steel safecracker, who joins Charlie and his former gang when they follow the backstabber to California, where they plan to re-steal the gold by tapping into Los Angeles&amp;#039; traffic control system, manipulating signals and creating one of the biggest traffic jams in LA history. Now the job isn&amp;#039;t the payoff, it&amp;#039;s about payback.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31d5415d6bf21001c742ec4e715ac138f990cb6b","amp;dn":"The.Italian.Job.DVDRip.XviD.SWESUB-JESS.avi.++++-Action","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31d5415d6bf21001c742ec4e715ac138f990cb6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,213,65,93,107,242,16,1,199,66,236,78,113,90,193,56,249,144,203,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
