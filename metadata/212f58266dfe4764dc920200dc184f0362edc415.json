I love this album, I hope you do too...\n\nplease support the band by actually buying this if you like it... even though it's incredibly hard to find in real life... so unless you get it off iTunes or Zune... you'll probably have to buy it off the band's website... either way - enjoy this album. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n&quot;The Way and Its Power&quot; is the debut album by the hard rock/electronica duo Anarchy Club, released in August 12, 2005.\n\nThe album is heavily influenced by many different musical genres from death metal, through alternative rock, heavy metal, hip hop and even Chinese classical beats.\n\nThe album mixes death metal riffs, hip hop grooves and Chinese classical and waltz beats, all with a decidedly heavy rock flavor throughout, which makes the album very unusual.\n\nOut of the 15 tracks on the album, 12 of them are notable as songs. The other three tracks are: &quot;White Noise&quot; which is an intro to the album and consists of the changing of radio stations until it finally stops at the start of &quot;Enemy Ace.&quot; &quot;A Day at the Office&quot; which is basically the sound of a robbery and features guest vocals from &quot;Jessica Lee&quot; and &quot;Skillz&quot; which is the sound of two people playing a video game.\n\nThe album gained much attention after the release of the video game Guitar Hero which features the song &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; which became very popular because of the game and raised the popularity of the band.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Keith Smith and Adam von Buhler.\n\n   1. &quot;White Noise&quot; - 0:21 (lead in/intro to the album)\n   2. &quot;Enemy Ace&quot; - 3:21\n   3. &quot;Guilty (Come Drink with Me)&quot; - 4:09\n   4. &quot;King of Everything&quot; - 3:35\n   5. &quot;Bitter&quot; - 2:33\n   6. &quot;Hidden By Blue&quot; - 2:57\n   7. &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; - 2:46 (featured in Guitar Hero II)\n   8. &quot;A Day at the Office&quot; - 0:47 (lead in to &quot;Kill for You&quot;)\n   9. &quot;Kill for You&quot; - 2:41\n  10. &quot;Assassins&quot; - 3:40\n  11. &quot;Through Windows Clear&quot; - 4:01\n  12. &quot;Skillz&quot; - 0:55 (lead in to &quot;Boss Fight&quot;)\n  13. &quot;Boss Fight&quot; - 2:10\n  14. &quot;Shaolin&quot; - 3:02\n  15. &quot;Wicked World&quot; - 2:54\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Keith Smith - lead vocals, guitar\n    * Adam von Buhler - bass, guitar, drums\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n P.S. - Please seed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:212f58266dfe4764dc920200dc184f0362edc415","amp;dn":"Anarchy+Club+-+The+Way+and+its+Power+%28full+album%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"212f58266dfe4764dc920200dc184f0362edc415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,47,88,38,109,254,71,100,220,146,2,0,220,24,79,3,98,237,196,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
