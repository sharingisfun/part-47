This 'greatest hits' compilation includes their rendition of &quot;Counting Flowers on the Wall' (well known from Pulp Fiction) and many other covers.\n\nDon't miss the job they do on 'Ruby,' a song made famous by one Mr. Kenny Rogers. Perhaps more than any other song in their catalog (which is really saying something), this one exemplifies their uncanny ability to strip any song of absolutely any emotional resonance it once might have had. Indeed, the &quot;World of the Statler Brothers,&quot; as the album cover shows, is one of butterflies, flowers, and cross-stitch rainbows.\n\nYou'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll throw up in your mouth a little.
