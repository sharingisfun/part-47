The reason for starting this band was Bogdan's desire to play the music that he likes: heavy metal &amp; melodic rock\nThe recordings for the 1st album (having more of a demo purpose) started in spring 2002. After two months of intense work, the material was ready. Twelve power melodic heavy metal songs, in the vein of Rhapsody, Nightwish and Helloween, which show the high potential of the band. The album, entitled &quot;The Scroll of Stone&quot;, tells the story of princess Alma tricked by a demon, she loses her soul and so her quest begins. She has to find The Scroll of Stone, the only thing powerful enough to break the demon's spell. &quot;The Scroll of Stone&quot; was produced in Romania by Sigma Records and was well received by the media, in spite of the lack of promotion. The second album, &quot;Lightseeker&quot;, has been launched in October 2004 in France through Underclass Music. Magica's first video, &quot;Bittersweet Nightshade&quot;, was ready on February 10, 2005. Magica has been featured in the famous &quot;Metallian&quot; and &quot;Rock Hard Magazine&quot;. In 2006 the band had the pleasure of touring Europe opening for After Forever and Nightmare, Apocalyptica and Leaves Eyes.\n\nThe third album is called Hereafter and was released at 19 October 2007 via AFM Records Germany. 2 videos were shot for this album, &quot; All waters have the colour of drowning&quot; and &quot;Entangled&quot;. In November 2007 Ana was invited to take part in the huge Hellish Rock tour alongside Helloween, Gamma Ray and Axxis for 3 months of intense touring.\n\nThe band's latest release is called &quot;Wolves and Witches&quot; and was released through AFM Records in October 2008, the band is currently in search of a serious booking agency.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nDiscography:\n\n\n2002-The Scroll Of Stone@128-192kbps\n1.The Wish 00:56 \n2.A Blood Red Dream 04:33\n3.The Sun is Gone 01:07\n4.The Sorcerer 04:44\n5.Road to the Unknown 04:42\n6.Daca 03:58\n7.E Magic 03:52\n8.The Silent Forest 04:26\n9.Mountains of Ice 05:05\n10.The Key 02:35\n11.The Scroll of Stone 04:31\n12.Redemption 05:10\n____________________________\n\n\n2003-The Scroll Of Stone (Bonus Edition) @ VBR &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img204.imageshack.us/img204/9273/coverlq5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img204.imageshack.us/img204/9273/coverlq5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n01.The Wish 0:54\n02.Chipul Din Luna 4:07\n03.A Blood Red Dream 4:30\n04.The Sun Is Gone 1:04\n05.The Sorcerer 4:43\n06.Road To The Unknown 4:39\n07.Daca 3:56\n08.E Magic 3:50\n09.The Silent Forest 4:26\n10.Mountains Of Ice 5:05\n11.The Key 2:32\n12.The Scroll Of Stone 4:30\n13.Redemption 5:10\n14.Daca Acoustic Version 4:08\n\n____________________________\n\n\n2004-Lightseeker @ VBR &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/Magica-Lightseeker.jpg/200px-Magica-Lightseeker.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/Magica-Lightseeker.jpg/200px-Magica-Lightseeker.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n1.The Circle 01:32\n2.Bind You Forever 04:47\n3.Bittersweet Nightshade 04:09\n4.Dance of the Wasp 04:17\n5.A New Paradise 03:17\n6.Samhain 03:22\n7.Witch's Broom 04:01\n8.The Living Grimoire 05:40\n9.Black Lace 04:18\n10.Curse for Eternity 04:48\n11.Wormwood 04:51\n12.Inluminata 04:11\n\n____________________________\n\n\n2007-Hereafter @ VBR &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Magica-Hereafter.jpg/200px-Magica-Hereafter.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Magica-Hereafter.jpg/200px-Magica-Hereafter.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n.All Waters Have the Colour of Drowning 05:13\n2.Turn to Stone 05:19\n3.Through Wine 04:25\n4.No Matter What 04:35\n5.Entangled 04:36\n6.This is Who I Am 04:45\n7.The Weight of the World 04:51\n8.Energy for the Gods 04:39\n9.Shallow Grave 04:13\n10.I Remember A Day 04:18\n11.Into Silence 03:26\n____________________________\n\n\n\n2008-Wolves And Witches @ VBR &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.destination-rock.com/rockint/images/magicaww.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.destination-rock.com/rockint/images/magicaww.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n1.Don't Wanna' Kill 04:59\n2.They Stole the Sun 05:01\n3.Hold on Tight 05:42\n4.Hurry up Ravens 04:50\n5.Maiastra 02:36\n6.Dark Secret 04:21\n7.Just for Two Coins 05:06\n8.Until the Light Is Gone 05:09\n9.Chitaroptera 02:53 \n10.Mistress of the Wind 05:00\n11.In the Depths of the Lake (Bonus) 04:49\n____________________________\n\n\n2010-Dark Diary @ VBR &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img517.imageshack.us/img517/1691/267374.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img517.imageshack.us/img517/1691/267374.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n01.
