Dennett. The film weaves interviews with Hofstadter with adaptations of several works in the book: Dennett&amp;#039;s Where am I?, The Soul of the Mark III Beast by Terrel Miedaner, and also the short story The Seventh Sally by StanisÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¡aw Lem. The film was shown several times on television in Holland in the late eighties&quot;.\n\n------------------\n\nI thought the film was pretty great, slow to start with, but great eventually. The ideas are expressed pretty well and in a manner that I feel would gradually acquaint someone unfamiliar with them to at least the point of comprehension, if not acceptance, of the most advanced (Ok, the unfamiliar are going to miss some of what Hofstadter&amp;#039;s getting at.., but the main ideas are accessible). What&amp;#039;s really great is watching Dennett and Minsky doing a pretty good job of acting out a scenario that the docudrama never explicitly reveals is fictional :) At the same time as being absolutely hilarious, it shows the intense conviction of the film&amp;#039;s participants that the ideas are true. \n\nIf the ideas in the film interest you, you should check out some of the books written by Hofstadter, Minsky, and/or Dennett. GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶del, Escher, Bach; Society of Mind; or Consciousness Explained will give you more detail and an idea of the foundations of the ideas. Each book has a unique flavor and difficulty, but they&amp;#039;re all good.\n\n-weston","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd99bd761736ec4e4eb22ce45478ef2e65325c8e","amp;dn":"VICTIM_OF_THE_BRAIN-1988.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd99bd761736ec4e4eb22ce45478ef2e65325c8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,153,189,118,23,54,236,78,78,178,44,228,84,120,239,46,101,50,92,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
