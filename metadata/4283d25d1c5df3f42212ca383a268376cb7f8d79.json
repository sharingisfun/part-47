The song was released worldwide on April 15, 2011, four days ahead of its scheduled release, by Interscope Records. Written and produced by Lady Gaga and RedOne, &quot;Judas&quot; is a dance song that speaks of a woman in love with a man who betrays her while simultaneously embodying things that have haunted her in the past, thus representing something that was bad for her ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ something she could not escape. Gaga explained that it's also about &quot;honoring your darkness in order to bring yourself into the light, [...] You have to look into whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s haunting you and need to learn to forgive yourself in order to move on.&quot;[2]\n&quot;Judas&quot; has a similar sound to Gaga's previous singles like &quot;Poker Face&quot;, &quot;LoveGame&quot;, &quot;Bad Romance&quot;, and &quot;Alejandro&quot;, and contains three distinct hooks and a break down influenced by house music. The breakdown contains influences of tribal-techno and dubstep. Gaga explained that the lines spoken during the breakdown talks about her being beyond the ability to redeem herself, in terms of the traditional views of what a woman is supposed to be. The artwork for the single was designed by Gaga in Microsoft Word and features a black background with the word &quot;Judas&quot; written in red capital letters in Impact font. It was released via her web video series, Transmission Gagavision. Critics noted similarity between &quot;Judas&quot; and &quot;Bad Romance&quot;, but praised the musical production of the song, complimenting its energy and the robotic break down.\nA music video for the song was filmed in early April, co-directed by Gaga and Laurieann Gibson and co-starring Norman Reedus. It includes a Biblical storyline where Reedus plays Judas Iscariot and Gaga plays Mary Magdalene. Prior to its release, the Catholic League condemned Gaga for the alleged use of religious imagery and her role as Magdalene in the video.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4283d25d1c5df3f42212ca383a268376cb7f8d79","amp;dn":"Lady+Gaga+Judas+Super+HD+Quality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4283d25d1c5df3f42212ca383a268376cb7f8d79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,131,210,93,28,93,243,244,34,18,202,56,58,38,131,118,203,127,141,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
