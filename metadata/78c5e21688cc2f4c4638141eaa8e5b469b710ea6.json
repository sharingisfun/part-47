He figures voters who&amp;#039;ll never make near that will think he&amp;#039;s going to stick it to the rich. People ask if he&amp;#039;s talking gross or net. Someone needs to ask Obama these questions! He&amp;#039;s just thrown out this number.

Now it&amp;#039;s been exposed that the Democrat who replaced Foley, Rep. Tim Mahoney (D-FL) paid $121,000 in hush money to his mistress, and gave her a sweetheart job for two years to keep her quiet.

Rush explains where we are in the campaign with three weeks left. McCain surged before, when he picked Sarah Palin (meaning when he went conservative) and he can surge again if he fights. (Rush 24/7 Members: Listen Here)\nPearl of Wisdom: &quot;Senator McCain&amp;#039;s original supporters like Bill Kristol ought to be happy with McCain&amp;#039;s campaign. They wanted somebody nice not negative. They thought conservatism was old and needed redefining. Now that their strategy is tanking just as all of us outside the Beltway predicted, these moderate Republicans are calling on McCain to fire his campaign!&quot; (Rush 24/7 Members: Listen Here)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Bill Kristol in the New York Times: McCain Should Fire His Campaign\n\nLiberals, who have spent eight years stoking hate for Bush and Republicans, wring their hands about one or two unidentified people (who could be Obama plants!) shouting at McCain rallies. Rush played some examples of hate -- real, liberal hate.\n\nObama says today that he never heard of the voter fraud organization ACORN, but we have audio of The Messiah in 2007 telling ACORN, &quot;[W]e&amp;#039;re going to be calling all of you in to help us shape the agenda ... so that you have input into the agenda for the next presidency of the United States of America.&quot; (Rush 24/7 Members: Listen Here)\n\nPearl of Wisdom: &quot;You need profit to hire people, Obama, not government! A tax cut based on hiring people doesn&amp;#039;t cover the cost. I don&amp;#039;t even think Obama cares or even knows this. He&amp;#039;s a socialist. He simply cannot bring himself to leave businesses alone.&quot;\n\nFrom Rush&amp;#039;s Stack of Stuff Quick Hits Page:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Bad Economy? NYC Hookers Doing Well Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Market Up, Gas Down.
