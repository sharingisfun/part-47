Meanwhile, Gizmo&amp;#039;s former owner has just died and he&amp;#039;s been captured for the genetics part of the Clamp building. A little while later, a certain someone gets wet, creates a new Gremlin species, and learns to finally fight back after years of abuse. And while Gizmo and the surviving humans fight back, the Gremlins and their evil leader, the Brain Gremlin, are planning to escape when it gets dark. And if they do, New York will experience a new Hell. Written by Will \n\nYesterday it was rural Kingston Falls. Today it&amp;#039;s the Big Apple -- and lots of wild, anarchic comedy -- because a new batch of mischievous green meanies is on the loose. We told you. Remember the rules. You didn&amp;#039;t listen. Now you&amp;#039;ll have to face up to the hilarious consequences.
