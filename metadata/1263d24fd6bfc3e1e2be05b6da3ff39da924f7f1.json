He waves his freak-flag high with this release. \n\n\nSome of the songs on the soundtrack are the narrator bridging the scenes (the narrator, Zach Selwyn, actually exists in the movie, though, and he and his band get turned into zombies, too). It's totally bizzare, tongue-in-cheek, and brilliant.\n\nSo, a great country/hip-hop/folk soundtrack to an equally quirky movie. Both are highly recommended. \n\n\nRelease type:   Album\nRelease source: CD\nYear:           2005\nDuration:       24:30\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n1.  Possessed (Is The Way To Be)\n2.  Traumatized\n3.  We're Comin' To Kill Ya\t\n4.  Hand Me Some Chew \t\n5.  Johnny, Stay Away From That Box\n6.  Riding The Rails\n7.  David Kicks Ass\n8.  Ten Bucks That All Three Die\t\n9.  Quiet Little Town\t\n10.
