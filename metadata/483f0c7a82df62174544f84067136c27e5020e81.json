Soon after giving the Rap CoalitionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Wendy Day a copy of the Infinite album at a chance meeting, she helped the aspiring lyrical gymnast secure a spot at the CoalitionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 1997 Rap Olympics in Los Angeles, where he won second place in the freestyle competition. During the trip, Eminem and his manager, Paul Rosenberg, gave a few people from Interscope Records his demo and he made his major radio debut on the world famous Wake Up Show with Sway and Tech. Realizing that this was the opportunity of his lifetime, Eminem delivered a furious medley of lyrics that wowed his hosts and radio audience alike.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI felt like itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s my time to shine,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Eminem says of that performance. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI have to rip this. At that time, I felt that it was a life or death situation.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nTracks\n\n01 Intro\n02 In This Game feat Notorious Big\n03 Monkeyz\n04 Soldier (Remix) feat G-Unit\n05 Till I Collapse (Remix) (Exclu) feat 50 Cent &amp; 2pac\n06 The What feat Method Man Royce Da 59 &amp; Dj Clue\n07 Ill Hit Em Up (Exclu) feat D-12\n08 Touchdown feat T.i\n09 Drug Ballad (Exclu)\n10 Square Dance\n11 Low Down Dirty (Exclu)\n12 Bodyguard feat Dr Dre &amp; Obie Trice\n13 We Came 2 Party (Exclu) feat 40 Glocc &amp; Jayo Felony\n14 Dead Wrong feat Notorious Big\n15 If I Get Locked Up Tonight feat Dr Dre\n16 Peep Show feat 50 Cent\n17 Hands On You feat Obie Trice\n18 Jimmy Crack Corn feat 50 Cent\n19 Im Having A Relapse (New Single)\n\nDATE :  2008-12-02\nARTIST :  Eminem\nTITLE :  Long Time No See (official mixtape)\nGENRE :  Hip-Hop\nLABEL :  Sowax Music / Musicast\nRUNTIME: 76:54\nSIZE: 83.63mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:483f0c7a82df62174544f84067136c27e5020e81","amp;dn":"Eminem+-+Long+Time+No+See+%28bootleg%29+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"483f0c7a82df62174544f84067136c27e5020e81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,63,12,122,130,223,98,23,69,68,248,64,103,19,108,39,229,2,14,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
