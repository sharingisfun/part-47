ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The book is divided into a chapter for each day of a lunation cycle ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ . I thoroughly enjoyed reading this guide to observing the Moon. I highly recommend it to anyone interested learning about our celestial companion. You will have hours of enjoyment as this book opens up the Moon to your eyes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Robert Garfinkle, The Observatory, Vol. 131 (1223), August, 2011)\nProduct Description\nOf all the many things we can look at in the night sky, the Moon is one of the richest in its ever-changing detail, as changes in light and shadow daily transform what you can see of every feature.

Moonwalk with Your Eyes guides the reader quickly through lunar basics: how to determine the lunar day and what lunar terminology you might encounter here and in other books.
