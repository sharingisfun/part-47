Though it is clear the artists on the tribute are sincere in their affection for Holly, their covers add nothing to the original versions. Few of the selections attempt a reinterpretation of the song, and those that do aren't successful. When the cover is close to the original, it doesn't sound as fresh as Holly's version. Consequently, the best way to keep Holly's memory alive is to replay his records, not this collection.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/not-fade-away-remembering-buddy-holly-r231199&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/not-fade-away-remembering-buddy-holly-r231199&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002OWS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002OWS&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
