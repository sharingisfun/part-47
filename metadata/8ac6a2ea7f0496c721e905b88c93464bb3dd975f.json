In &quot;HISTORY'S RAIDERS&quot; some of the most exciting and decisive small unit actions have been minutely researched and uncovered with unprecedented access to over 500,000 hours of archive film, much of which will be seen in the series for the first time. \n\nProduced by Nugus / Martin Productions Ltd for the History Channel MMI\n\n\n\nEpisode 15 : The Capture of Fort Eben Emael\n\nAs German troops moved forward to their battle stations to begin Hitler's 1940 Blitzkrieg in the West, gliders swooped out of the dawn sky onto the Belgian fortress which dominated bridges vital for the German advance. Within a few hours less than 400 German paratroops had neutralised this supposedly impregnable fortification and seized the bridges.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2267 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 44:46.411\nNumber Of Parts: 26\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ac6a2ea7f0496c721e905b88c93464bb3dd975f","amp;dn":"HC.History%27s.Raiders.15of26.The.Capture.of.Fort.Eben.Emael.XviD.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ac6a2ea7f0496c721e905b88c93464bb3dd975f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,198,162,234,127,4,150,199,33,233,5,184,140,147,70,75,179,221,151,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
