The former is a duet with his younger sister Janet Jackson, whereas the latter is a solo piece.\n\n&quot;Scream&quot; is cited primarily as an aggressive, retaliatory song directed at the tabloid media and their coverage of the child sexual abuse accusations made against Michael Jackson in 1993. &quot;Scream&quot; was written, composed and produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis; Jackson played many of the instruments. It incorporates elements of pop, R&amp;B, hip hop, funk and rock. The song was leaked to radio stations early, despite Epic Records' attempt to keep it off air until the official release date. Generally well received amongst critics, it has been compared favorably to other accomplished pieces by Jackson. It went on to be nominated for a Grammy Award and an American Music Award. The corresponding music video remains one of Jackson's most critically acclaimed pieces; it won numerous MTV Video Music Awards and a Grammy. At a cost of $ 7 million, it is listed in the Guinness World Records as the most expensive music video ever made. The imagery in &quot;Scream&quot; has been replicated in several contemporary pieces, including &quot;No Scrubs&quot; by TLC and &quot;Shawty Get Loose&quot; by Lil Mama.\n\n&quot;Scream&quot;/&quot;Childhood&quot; would become the first single in the 37 year history of Billboard to debut at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked. It was a worldwide hit, reaching the top five in the vast majority of major music markets.\n\nThe 4:46 minute music video for &quot;Scream&quot; was choreographed by Jackson, directed by Mark Romanek, with the production being designed by Tom Foden. Jackson did not create the &quot;concept&quot; for the video, which he had often done in the past, but left it to Romanek. Jackson later described the making of &quot;Scream&quot; as a collaborative effort. The song and its accompanying video are a response to the backlash Jackson received from the media in 1993.\n\nFoden commented, &quot;Mark had written the treatment and the general idea was that Michael and Janet were on this large spacecraft. And they, were alone...They were getting away from Earth, and the different sets were the different environments on the spacecraft where they could have a little bit of fun and where they could relax&quot;. Production of the music video's 13-piece set were restricted to a one-month period and is produced by Foden art directors Richard Berg, Jeff Hall, and Martin Mervel. Foden describes the assignment as a &quot;military operation&quot; explaining, &quot;The idea was to give each of the art directors three sets: a complicated one, a not-so-complicated one, and one of the smaller, easier vignettes.&quot; Typography in the video was designed by P. Scott Makela. Jackson was happy to work with his sister again, explaining that as they still had a passion for dancing it reminded him of &quot;old times.&quot;\n\nIn the video, Janet Jackson takes on a darker persona, previously unseen in her own music videos. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News described her as &quot;Sporting a thick thatch of wig hair, and eyes darkened by coal-black makeup...sullen and arty...Janet, however, never looked tougher, or more in control.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ed9d0837ede018b8d397138af4596bd4bff320d","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+featuring+Janet+Jackson+-+Scream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ed9d0837ede018b8d397138af4596bd4bff320d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,217,208,131,126,222,1,139,141,57,113,56,175,69,150,189,75,255,50,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
