Besides disabling Windows and some of its components to communicate with Microsoft servers, xpy improves privacy settings and your systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s security.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Disable Windows communicating with Microsoft\n\n- Disable questionable services\n\n- Tweak Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player\n\n- Remove Windows Messenger\n\n- Improve privacy and security\n\n- Improve performance\n\n\nThe sourcecode is available under a BSD license, versions prior to 0.10 were released under the GNU General Public License (GPL v2).\n\nMake sure you carefully choose the settings you want to apply, to avoid problems. If you experience trouble, refer to the Frequently Asked Questions or report a bug on SourceForge.\n\nxpy is currently available in two versions, Redistributable and Monolingual.\nThe Redistributable build includes all available languages and is intended for distribution on offline-media (i.e. CD-ROM) or Intranet, while the Monolingual builds try to save bandwidth for fastest possible download speed.\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\nFirst of all, make sure that you check the settings you want to apply do not disable any features, you might still require. The automatic detection of xpy only indicates which settings can be made, this does not mean that the software recommends these settings.\n\n\nWhy would I need xpy to apply these settings?\n\nYou can change all settings xpy does within the affected software or the registry-editor. However, if you install Windows on many computer or reinstall your system frequently, you might prefer to apply these settings from one software, as it speeds up the process dramatically.\n\nWhich xpy settings do you recommend?\n\nI will not recommend any settings, you should specify which settings fit your needs.\n\nWhat are the red checkboxes, why canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t I select them?\n\nThe red checkboxes are blocking settings that are either not available to your specific operating system, or they have been applied already in a previous xpy session. To undo settings, you need to run xpy in restore-mode.\n\nWhy does software X no longer work?\n\nYou have applied a setting, that disables a feature (most likely a service), that is required by the software you are using. You can simply restore previously made changes.\n\nWhy is Windows asking me for a password on login?\n\nYou have applied the setting Disable showing last user. Have a look at MicrosoftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s support page on that issue, otherwise you might have to reinstall Windows.\n\nWhy does shutting down the computer take so long?\n\nYou have chosen the Delete Pagefile on Shutdown feature.\nDeleting the pagefile usually takes several minutes.\n\nWhy does xpy keep on detecting settings I already applied?\n\nThe autodetection does not work flawlessly.\nAt least the Uninstall Windows Messenger setting does not yet get detected automatically.\n\nWhy do some of my streams not work?\n\nYou have most likely disabled Automatic License Acquisition.\nTo enable it again, run xpy again in restore-mode.\n\nHow can I restore the setting(s) made with xpy?\n\nYou can run xpy again and then choose the restoration-mode.\nThis detects all previously made changes, so be careful in choosing what settings you want to restore.\n\nCan I silently apply settings?\n\nYes, you have the option to run xpy with command-line switches.\nAt the moment there are only two silent-modes available, xpy.exe /? lists all available switches. The batch-mode also works silently.\n\nIs it possible to save my settings for future use?\n\nYes, you have to run xpy from command-line (xpy.exe /file).\nThat will save a file on your desktop, which stores your preferred settings.\nThe next time open the configuration-file from the command-line (xpy.exe settings.xpy) to apply the same settings again.\n\nWhich Windows versions does xpy support?\n\nxpy has primarily made for Windows XP.\nIt has been tested on Windows XP Professional and Windows 2003 Server.\nDue to the similarity of all Windows NT 5.x versions, it should also work on Windows 2000 and Vista. However, there is a special version for Windows Vista availabe.\n\nIs xpy still required on Windows XP SP2?\n\nMicrosoft has patched various flaws in SP2, but you can still be able to disable unwanted services or change behaviours of included software and other features.\n\nWhy canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t I install SP1 over my Windows XP installation?\n\nThis problem can appear, when you have previously disabled the Registration Wizard Control (read this MSDN article ). You can fix this by enabling it again.\n\nCan the IE settings be ignored when using an alternative browser?\n\nIt is quite usual that some non-browser software uses Internet Explorer to download files or render webpages. As a result, applying the Internet Explorer related options of xpy should be considered.\n\nWill there be internationalized versions of xpy?\n\nYou can find a selection of translations at SourceForge, translations will be added to the official version, once all features were implemented.\nIf you want to compile xpy with a custom translation, all you need is a simple text-editor and the NSIS compiler (details here).\n\nWhich command-line switches are available?\n\nxpy supports a couple of switches to save settings or do tasks silent/unattended. To get a list of available commands, use the command-line (xpy.exe /help).\n\nIs it possible to choose which language to use?\n\nYes, you need to run xpy from command-line (xpy.exe /lang) and choose your preferred language from the menu.\n\nCan xpy by used silently?\n\nThere are multiple ways to run xpy unattended. using the commandline xpy.exe /help you will get a list of options. If you use a preferences file (.xpy), it will run silent by default.\n\nIs there a portable version?\n\nxpy is portable out of the box, no installation is required, you can use it from anywhere. However, if you want to undo the settings at some point, you must at least be logged in using the same user.\n\nIs there a setup to install xpy?\n\nBy default, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no need to install xpy. however, if you use xpy regularly thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a way to make it work a bit more comfortable.\nTo associate xpy with its batch-files, you can use the xpy.exe /install in the command-line. Additionally you can create a set of useful shortcuts with xpy.exe /shortcuts\n\nHow can I save my prefered options?\n\nUsing the command-line xpy.exe /file you can run xpy as normal, but it wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t apply any of the changes you chose. Instead these settings get saved in a file (.xpy) on your Desktop. If xpy is associated with xpy-files (xpy.exe /install), you can double-click the xpy-file. In all other cases you can use the command-line or drag &amp; drop to apply the settings from the file.\n\nWhat are the Special Builds?\n\nThere are two kinds of special builds available on SourceForge.\nThose with the letter i attached to the version number (e.g. xpy-0.9.9i-bin.zip), use Ixquick as default search-engine. minixpy is a smaller version of xpy with same functionality, but less comfort. It is recommended for experienced users only.\n\nHow can I contribute a translation of xpy?\n\nThis article sums up the procedure necessary to contribute a translation.\nTo stay updated once a new version (with new dialogs) of xpy was released, it is recommended to sign up to the mailing-list.\n\nWhy is xpy written in NSIS?\n\nThe decision to write it in NSIS fruited on a healthy combination of curiousity and challenge. So far all tasks could be accomplished and the syntax is very easy to understand.\n\nHow can I compile from the sourcecode?\n\nIn order to compile the NSIS sourcecode, you will need makensis or itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s graphical user interface. Both come with the NSIS package.\nIf you need additional dll-files for compilation, refer to the makensis log-file.\n\nWhy does my antivirus software detect xpy as malware?\n\nThis is not a problem specifically happening to xpy, but a problem all NSIS compiled programs deal with. You can read more about this in the NSIS forums or on their SourceForge page.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f58beb6281346240f009e99b279389c5d67c40a","amp;dn":"xpy+1.0.0+Beta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f58beb6281346240f009e99b279389c5d67c40a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,88,190,182,40,19,70,36,15,0,158,153,178,121,56,156,93,103,196,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
