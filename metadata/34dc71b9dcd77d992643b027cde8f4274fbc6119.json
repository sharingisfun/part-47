WinEdt's\nhighlighting schemes can be customized for different\nmodes and its spell checking functionality supports\nmulti-lingual setups, with dictionaries (word-lists)\nfor many languages available for downloading from\nWinEdt's Community Site www.winedt.org\n\nAlthough WinEdt is reasonably suitable as an\nall-purpose text editor it has been specifically\ndesigned and configured to integrate seamlessly with\na TeX System (such as MiKTeX or TeX Live). WinEdt\ndocumentation does not cover TeX related topics in\ndepth. You'll find introductions and manuals on\ntypesetting with [La]TeX, as well as links to other\nrecommended accessories, on TeX's Community Site\n(TUG)\n\nMajor new features in WinEdt 6.0:\n* WinEdt's Interface (toolbar) has changed. A single\nbutton is now used to select and start the TeX\nCompiler of your choice. The drop-down menu allows\nyou to choose from PDFLaTeX, LaTeX, XeTeX, TeX\nAMSTeX, etc... Once you make your choice you can\nstart the selected compiler by clicking on the\nbutton\n* The new interface also features context-sensitive\nCompile and Preview buttons. Their meaning for TeX\ndocuments can be configured through the Execution\nModes Interface\n* Configuration Filters are used to make Menu Items\nand Toolbars visible or invisible depending on the\nconfiguration choice (MiKTeX, Tex Live, HTML\netc...)\n* Console Applications are by default executed in\nWinEdt's own Console Window. This can be\ncustomized in the Execution Modes interface\n* Highlighting now allows specification of\nenvironment-sensitive background colors\n* Support for compiling MetaPost documents and\nDocumented LaTeX (DTX)\n* And there is more &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.winedt.com/work/News.txt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.winedt.com/work/News.txt&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nDo NOT distribute this release outside of the scene\nKeep the scene alive and secure!\n\nAll good progs start as freeware\nthen things get worse ...\n\nINSTALLATION NOTES\n\n`TLB'\nTry it, Like it, Buy it!\n\n1.
