Spiritual progressive jazz including remix to the theme to game &quot;No More Heroes&quot;.\n\nThe Outer Rim is a Japanese band sporting a smooth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œspiritual jazzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sound and epic hairstyles. The group is headed by bassist Jeff Curry (not Japanese!) and features game composer Norihiko Hibino on sax and computer, Hakuei Kim on keys, and Nobuaki Fujii on drums. While the album is dominated by catchy jazz pieces with a distinctive atmosphere, a few tracks include bits of English vocal drama featuring No More Heroes front man Travis Touchdown and co-star Silvia Christal as they describe a bleak, musicless future in outer space. And yes, they used the same voice actors from the game!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdbaby.com/cd/outerrim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdbaby.com/cd/outerrim&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n1.
