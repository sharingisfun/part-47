It featured the manic adventures of an enthusiastic dog name Roobarb, and the cynical cat Custard, who wants to sabatoge the dog's fun.  These 30 five-minute episodes of roughly drawn animation became a cult favorite in the UK, and was followed by a sequel series in 2005.  It was written by George Calveley, animated by Bob Godfrey, and voiced by Richard Briers,  with a theme by Johnny Hawksworth that became hugely popular in its own right.\n\n512x384  25fps   XVID mp3  2ch   30 episodes of 4+ minutes each","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:926d19f0e2d1ca596e890b53f31fe1fb5d6d0e6a","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Roobarb+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"926d19f0e2d1ca596e890b53f31fe1fb5d6d0e6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,109,25,240,226,209,202,89,110,137,11,83,243,31,225,251,93,109,14,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
