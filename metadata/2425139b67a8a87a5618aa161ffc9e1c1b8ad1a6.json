This behavior is too much for parents to handle. Dr. Phil, along with Dr. Alan Kazdin, professor of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale University and author of The Kazdin Method for Parenting the Defiant Child, has advice for managing aggressive behavior. Talena says she lives in fear of her 8-year-old son, Rhys. She and her husband, Derek, say the boy punches, bites and spits on them and threatens to kill them while theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re sleeping. Then, when Ron and Christine last appeared on the show, they were desperate for help with their 10-year-old son, Zachary. They said he tackled and kicked them and terrorized the family pets. Now they fear he has a more disturbing problem. Learn what it is, and why the couple says they may be headed for divorce. Plus, when Scott and Carolin last sat down with Dr. Phil, they couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t control their 12-year-old son, Nathaniel, who they say choked them and broke windows. Four months have passed since they pleaded for an intervention. See their amazing update!
