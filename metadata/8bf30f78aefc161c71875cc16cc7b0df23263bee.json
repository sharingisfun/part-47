For the first time ever, this test lets us stream live HDTV from space so the public can experience what its like to be there.&quot;\n\nKnown as the Space Video Gateway, the system transmits high bandwidth digital television signals to the ground that are not only spectacular, but also valuable to scientists, engineers and managers. \n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Allen Farmer\n-------------------------\n\nProduced by: Douglas Paynter\n----------------------------\n\n\n\n[HDTV]\n\n\nTitle: Space Station And Beyond\nYear:  2007\nFile Size: 349 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:42:31\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1150 kbit/s\nFPS:  29.970000\nAudio Bitrate: 132 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (N/A)\n \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016021/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016021/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bf30f78aefc161c71875cc16cc7b0df23263bee","amp;dn":"Space+Station+And+Beyond-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bf30f78aefc161c71875cc16cc7b0df23263bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,243,15,120,174,252,22,28,113,135,92,193,108,199,176,223,35,38,59,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
