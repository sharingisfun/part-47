It is meant to be a REFERENCE, not a novel.\nThe best way to use it is to read and find all of the parts that you like and note all of the ideas, skills, and techniques that you would like to work on and improve. Then take those sections and either write them down or print them so you can review them and practice.\n\nSuccess with women is not like success with learning to use a light switch.\nSuccess with women is more like success with learning to play a musical instrument. It takes practice. At first, none of it makes any sense. Sometimes it seems as though all of your practice is nott making a difference.\nBut if you keep at it, eventually you will be playing songs. And then you will be writing songs. Next thing you know, you've become a master.\nSo take this book and use it as a workbook. Come back to it often. Reread the parts that you want to learn and integrate. And most importantly, DON'T STOP READING UNTIL YOU'RE DOING IT.\n\nMany people make the mistake of reading this book and then saying, I know that stuff before they've mastered the information through their experience.\nDon't make this mistake yourself.\n\n\nKeep reading and practicing and using it until you HAVE IT DOWN.\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e24ba7f33aa7f6b5c52396bad19a32aa8fb09e96","amp;dn":"Double+Your+Dating+%28the+complete+guide%29+by+David+De+Angelo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e24ba7f33aa7f6b5c52396bad19a32aa8fb09e96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,75,167,243,58,167,246,181,197,35,150,186,209,154,50,170,143,176,158,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
