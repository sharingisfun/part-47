Every December 25, this happily unmarried, upscale San Francisco couple embarks on a holiday tradition they have shared every year since they met - ditching their crazy families for a relaxing, fun-filled vacation in some sunny exotic locale. There, sipping margaritas by the pool, they toast the season, knowing they once again avoided the chaos and emotional fallout of their four respective households: divorced parents, squabbling siblings, out-of-control kids and all the simmering resentments and awkward moments that are the hallmarks of every family Christmas. But not in Christmas 2006. Shorts and sunglasses packed, Brad and Kate are trapped at the San Francisco airport by a fogbank that cancels every outbound flight. Worse yet, they are caught on camera by a local news crew, revealing their whereabouts to the whole city... and to their families.\n\nWith no escape and no excuses, they are now expected home by Brad's father (Robert Duvall) and Kate's mother (Mary Steenburgen), as well as Brad's mother (Sissy Spacek) and Kate's father (Jon Voight), thereby celebrating four Christmases in one day. As they brace themselves for a marathon of homecomings, Brad and Kate expect the worst-and that's exactly what they get. But as Brad counts down the minutes to their freedom, Kate surprisingly finds herself tuned to the ticking of a different clock. At the end of the day, each will gain a new perspective on where they came from... and where they're going. Getting to know themselves and each other as they really are could finally give them a chance at the kind of love they've only been playing at. Kate decides she would like to someday start a family, scaring Brad away. Brad eventually comes back to Kate, surprising her at her door with the line &quot;If we're going to have one, we must have two, so they can play together,&quot; as he realises how empty his life is and how much he loves Kate after spending hours alone at his father's home.\n\nA year later on New Year's Day 2008, the couple welcomes their first born child in a hospital: a baby girl. They attempted to keep the child's birth a secret from their families, but once again they were caught on camera by a local news crew who was covering the first birth of the new year thereby revealing the arrival of the child to the city...and to their families.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369436/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369436/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4162a7a88916a9801f232003a89d7765d63577e3","amp;dn":"Four-Christmases.2009.DVDrip%5Bvice%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4162a7a88916a9801f232003a89d7765d63577e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,98,167,168,137,22,169,128,31,35,32,3,168,157,119,101,214,53,119,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
