Arguably the quintessential album band, Pink Floyd is not well served by compilations, especially one on which the two parts of &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; are edited together and there&amp;#039;s a re-recording of &quot;Money.&quot; Stick to the full-length versions.\n\nWilliam Ruhlmann, AMG\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPink Floyd:\n\nDavid Gilmour (vocals, guitar)\nRoger Waters (vocals, bass)\nRichard Wright (keyboards)\nNick Mason (drums)\n\nAdditional personnel:\n\nDick Parry (saxophone)\nProducers: Pink Floyd, Bob Ezrin, David Gilmour, Roger Waters.\nEngineers include: James Guthrie.\n\nRecorded between 1971 and 1981.\n\nDigitally remastered by Doug Sax (The Mastering Lab, Los Angeles, California).\n\nTongue-in-cheek title aside, this short-but-sweet compilation makes a convincing case for latter-day Pink Floyd as solid students of rock-pop songcraft.\n\nTheir reputation as space cadets and (in the very early days) acid heads is a million miles away from the expertly crafted, melodic accessibility of the Pink Floyd presented here.\n\nSure, they were sonic explorers, but first and foremost they were a crowd-pleasing rock band (whether they liked it or not).\n\nFrom the longing ode to Syd Barrett &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; to the forceful social commentary of &quot;Sheep&quot; and &quot;Another Brick In The Wall,&quot; the band shows off their compositional chops over and above their considerable instrumental facility.\n\nAs a nod to the present, there&amp;#039;s even a remix of the classic &quot;Money,&quot; with a slightly more forceful rhythmic slant added.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEAC Log, Cue &amp; Complete Artwork Included.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\nP.S.: After you&amp;#039;ve done, please someone upload this to Demonoid.
