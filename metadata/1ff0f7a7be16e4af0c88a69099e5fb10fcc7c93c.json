However, I really DISLIKE avi format, because I like to be able to pop a quick burn right into my old DVD player &amp; browse around w/ menus.\n\nOK .. so here's the deal. I collected all of LotL Season 1 from PirateBay torrents, recoded them all through tMPGenc, normalized the audio, and compiled the first 17 episodes into two DVD discs w/DVDLabPro.  The original torrents were of highly varying quality, frame sizes, frame rates, sources, etc.. A few episodes were coded from VHS off a standard broadcast, for example. I tried pretty hard to retain or improve the original quality, but I didn't go crazy. The results:\n\n{Poor/Fair: Skylons, Elsewhen}\n{Fair/Good: Cha-Ka, SleestakGod, Dopey, Downstream, TagTeam, Stranger,Possession}\n{Good/VG: Album, Hole, Paku/Dinner, Search, Follow/Dinosaur, StoneSoup, Circle, Hurricane}\n\nI did bend the rules on mixing frame sizes in a VTS a little - combining 352x240 w/704x480 - but my player handled it easily.\n\nMore info: Each episode has a label &amp; snapshot on the title menu, which you can select. I hate having to watch the opening credits every time I start an episode, so when you select a title, it will jump right into the story. I used the opening credits as a looping background action menu for Disc #1, and the closing credits as a looping action background for Disc #2. If you let them play, each disc will play all episodes sequentially, then return to the title menu.\n\nSo here it is. I hope it makes life easier for people. I wish the starting quality was better - it's hard to recover quality from bad compressions. But I'm happy w/ the results.\n\nEnjoy .. hope it plays OK .. &amp; Please Seed, because I won't be able to for long!\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nSeason #2 can be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4846078/(Land_of_the_Lost_-_Season_2_-___s_01-06_DVD)_%5Bfuzz%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4846078/(Land_of_the_Lost_-_Season_2_-___s_01-06_DVD)_%5Bfuzz%5D&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ff0f7a7be16e4af0c88a69099e5fb10fcc7c93c","amp;dn":"%28Land+of+the+Lost+-+Season+1+-+%23%5C%27s+11-17+DVD%29+%5Bfuzz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ff0f7a7be16e4af0c88a69099e5fb10fcc7c93c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,240,247,167,190,22,228,175,12,136,166,144,153,229,251,16,252,199,201,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
