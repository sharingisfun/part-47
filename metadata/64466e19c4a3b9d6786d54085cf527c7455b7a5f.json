It has its moments, and has some merit as an historical document, but mostly it is a dreadful, cheesy, kiss-ass hour-long TV special starring a Bob Hope who had already begun to slip into dementia and a Tony Danza who all but blows him. It contains PITIFUL interviews with Presidents and their wives desperately attempting to appear human and humorous. Still, despite this schlock, a good deal of the archive footage is worth it. I predict you will come away from this with two conflicting thoughts; Bob Hope was a good ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ol fellow and we are diminished to have lost him, and there ought to be a special place in hell for TV executives who create these shows in these ways. A decent tribute to Bob would have simple to craft, but they had to puke out THIS thing.\n\nFor those who never saw Bob Hope at his best, click my name to go to his Vietnam USO tour specials. THOSE are worth it. This? Not so much.\n\nRambam1776\n\n\nBob Hope: Laughing with the Presidents (1996)\n\nDirector:Daniel Helfgott\n\nWriters:Martha Bolton (writer)\nDaniel Helfgott (writer)\n23 November 1996 (USA) more \n\nCast (Credited cast)\n\nBob Hope ...
