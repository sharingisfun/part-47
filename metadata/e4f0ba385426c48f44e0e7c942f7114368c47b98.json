It's a very good show rightly regarded by Cream fans as one of the best of the late '67 tour of the US. For its vintage, the recording is very good and you can really hear why Cream had such an impact as a live act. On Sweet Wine and Rollin' and Tumbin' Ginger and Jack really lock together allowing Eric free rein to shine: and shine he does. Highly recommended. - DR&quot;\n\nLineage and Info:\n\nSilvers &gt; CD-R (trade) &gt; EAC v. 9.99 Prebeta 4 (Secure, Offset Correct) &gt; FLAC (8) &gt; You!\n\nArtwork (from contributor, thanks!), checksums, EAC logs, and info file included.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n~Geetarz, February 2010\n\nwww.geetarz.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4f0ba385426c48f44e0e7c942f7114368c47b98","amp;dn":"Cream+-+The+Real+Ones+%28Rothmans+09-10%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4f0ba385426c48f44e0e7c942f7114368c47b98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,240,186,56,84,38,196,143,68,224,231,201,66,247,17,67,104,196,123,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
