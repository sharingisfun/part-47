Bradbury's work had previously been collected in various compilations, such as The Martian Chronicles and The October Country, but never in such a large volume (912 pages) or spanning such a long period of time.\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/stories_of_ray_bradbury.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/stories_of_ray_bradbury.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nStories Of Ray Bradbury - S01 - E01 - Golden Apples Of The Sun &amp; The One Who Waits\nStories Of Ray Bradbury - S01 - E02 - Tomorrow's Child\nStories Of Ray Bradbury - S01 - E03 - All Summer In A Day &amp; The Fog Horn\nStories Of Ray Bradbury - S01 - E04 - A Sound Of Thunder\nStories Of Ray Bradbury - S01 - E05 - Dark They Were &amp; Golden Eyed\n\n\n\nAudio\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nDuration : 29mn 14s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ffe0eb26a37aa2ee8aea824284f5fa99fc4fd02","amp;dn":"Stories+Of+Ray+Bradbury+-+S01+-+AudioBooks+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ffe0eb26a37aa2ee8aea824284f5fa99fc4fd02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,254,14,178,106,55,170,46,232,174,168,36,40,79,95,169,159,196,253,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
