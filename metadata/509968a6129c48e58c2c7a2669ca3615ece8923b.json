Make sure you uninstall any previous release that you may have, as well as any YoYo releases as to prevent problems.\n\nIf you do find a problem and are unable to launch, go to the directory where you installed GameMaker and zip up the logs folder and upload it somewhere so i can help as best as i can. By default the log folder will be in &quot;C:Users{UserName}AppDataRoamingGameMaker-Studiologs&quot;\n\nEnjoy ;D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:509968a6129c48e58c2c7a2669ca3615ece8923b","amp;dn":"GameMaker-Studio+Master+Collection+Auto-Update+Experimental+V2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"509968a6129c48e58c2c7a2669ca3615ece8923b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,153,104,166,18,156,72,229,140,44,122,38,105,202,54,21,236,232,146,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
