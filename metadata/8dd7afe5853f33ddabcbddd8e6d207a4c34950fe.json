She is much younger to Krishna and Balarama since she was born after Vasudeva was released from Kansa's prison.\n\nWhen Subhadra becomes of age, Balarama suggests her as a bride to Duryodhana, who is his favourite pupil. The entire family is against this due to DuryodhanaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputations as a notorious prince. Subhadra too resents this but nothing can be said because Balarama had already sent the proposal to Duryodhana.\n\nArjuna was in the midst of self-imposed pilgrimage, for breaking terms of the agreement he had had with his brothers regarding private time with their shared wife, Draupadi. With Krishna's help and blessing, Arjuna disguises himself as an ascetic and establishes a &quot;sageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s&quot; residence near Krishna's palace. Subhadra serves him, and falls in love with him. Subhadra asks Krishna to tell Arjun about her love. Krishna agrees and instructs Arjuna to carry Subhadra away and marry her in secret, but first arjun does not agree as he loves Draupadi but he could not refuse Krishna. Arjun kidnaps Subhadra. Balarama is alerted by the Vrishni guards he is full of wrath for Arjuna. Krishna pacifies him. BalaramaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relaxes and he agrees to their marriage.\n\nSubhadra and Arjuna had only one son, Abhimanyu. . He studied under the tutelage of Krishna, Kritvarma and Pradyumna. Later he married Uttara and had a son named Parikshit. Abhimanyu died in the Kurukshetra war. Parikshit becomes the sole surviving heir of the entire Kuru dynasty.[8] When he comes of age, the Pandavas appoint him as the king and retire to the Himalayas. Subhadra stays back to guide and mentor her grandson.\n\nAs she is goddess yogmaya, Subhadra is one of the three deities worshipped at the Jagannath temple at Puri, along with her brothers Krishna (as Jagannatha) and Balarama (or Balabhadra). One of the chariots in the annual Ratha Yatra is dedicated to her. Apart from it she is also worshiped by many communities in Odisha, West Bengal, Gujarat and other states of the nation.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-1\nVideo Bitrate: 702 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 352x272\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.294:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec:  MPEG-1 Layer 2\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 44100 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Hindi\nRunTime: 2:18:27\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]    \nDuration: 2:18:27","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dd7afe5853f33ddabcbddd8e6d207a4c34950fe","amp;dn":"Subhadra+Haran+%281964%29+Xvid+2cd+-+No+Subs+-+Jayshree+Gadkar%2C+Sahu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dd7afe5853f33ddabcbddd8e6d207a4c34950fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,215,175,229,133,63,51,221,171,203,221,216,230,210,7,164,195,73,80,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
