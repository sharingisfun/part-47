The story itself has a wartime setting: beautiful ballerina Myra (Vivien Leigh) meets and falls passionately in love with officer Roy Cronin (Robert Taylor), only to be parted from him when he is called to duty during World War I. Alone and increasingly destitute, she learns that he has been killed in action--and so, broken hearted and unconcerned for herself, she drifts into prostitution, plying the world&amp;#039;s oldest profession along Waterloo Bridge.\n\n1940 Running time 108 Min ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2a514003b2d43961f5b6233082ee22c0ea4893e","amp;dn":"WATERLOO_BRIDGE_DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2a514003b2d43961f5b6233082ee22c0ea4893e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,165,20,0,59,45,67,150,31,91,98,51,8,46,226,44,14,164,137,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
