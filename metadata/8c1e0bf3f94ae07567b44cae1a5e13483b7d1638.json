Witness that funky strut on Ã¢â‚¬Å“You CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Stop MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or the galloping rock of Ã¢â‚¬Å“FireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€these tunes waste no time getting down to business. Still, when Eldredge wants to revel in classic country vibes, he does so confidently, getting reflective on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lose It AllÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or taking it home on the big-band stomper Ã¢â‚¬Å“Illinois.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
