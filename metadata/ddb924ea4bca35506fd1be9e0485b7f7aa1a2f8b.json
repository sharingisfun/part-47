Hurt &lt;--Missing about 10 seconds from the beginning :(\n32. In This Twilight (Zero Sum)\n\nI'm no &quot;professional&quot; taper by any means so this doesn't conform to any specific taper credence, my apologies.  However this boot sounds amazing so I must have done something right! ;)  There are two blemishes on this otherwise perfect (imo) recording, I hit pause in the middle of &quot;The Frail&quot; so there's a split second skip and I missed about ten seconds of the beginning of &quot;Hurt&quot; because I had to switch storage mediums.\n\nIts lineage goes something like this:\n\nCanon Vixia HF10 &gt; Sony Vegas (Images and FLAC) &gt; Audacity (Splitting) &gt; MP3Tag (Tags, duh :P)\n\nEach track has an embedded image from its respective performance, though track 1's image I must credit to apogee (thanks, great image!)  I've also included original, full resolution (1920x1080) images for each song.  These images I've pulled directly out of the video for the show that I took so they've not gone through processing of any kind (except to add a watermark.)  I did keep the images separate in case you didn't want to download them.  I'd like to think the images are licensed under CC so if you use them please list the photo credit as &quot;chaonatic (JMW)&quot;. :)\n\nThe 1920x1080 30p video will be forthcoming.  I've also included a sample of that to wet your appetite, though you don't have to download it if you don't want to either.\n\nAs usual, please do not reencode to lossy format and upload anywhere; I've tried it just to check and it sounds shite.  And please do not try to turn a profit from this because it makes Trent cry. :(","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddb924ea4bca35506fd1be9e0485b7f7aa1a2f8b","amp;dn":"NIN+-+Lights+in+the+Sky+Over+St.+Louis+%288.20.2008%29+With+Images","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddb924ea4bca35506fd1be9e0485b7f7aa1a2f8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,185,36,234,75,202,53,80,111,209,190,158,4,133,183,247,170,26,47,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
