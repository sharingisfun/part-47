Then (2002). Released in 2003, it did not follow the success of her previous two singles, peaking at number thirty-two on the Billboard Hot 100, though its remixes by Paul Oakenfold, Ford, and Murk became club hits in the United States, propelling the song to number four on the Hot Dance Club Play. The song samples Schoolly D's 1986 song &quot;P.S.K. What Does It Mean?&quot;.\n\nThe music video was directed by David LaChapelle. The choreography by Jeffrey Hornaday was adapted from his work for the 1983 film Flashdance starring Jennifer Beals, whose character, Alexandra Owens, is also a construction worker by day and an exotic dancer at night. Lopez wore an outfit similar to that Beals wore in the actual film and she also stated that this was one of her most complicated videos and that a lot of effort was put in it. The video received four nominations at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards: Best Female Video, Best Dance Video, Best Choreography, and Best Art Direction.\n\nThe recreation of scenes from Flashdance led Maureen MarderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½whose life was the inspiration for the storyline of the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to sue Lopez, Sony Corporation, and Paramount Pictures for copyright infringement in November 2003, claiming the video was an unauthorized depiction of her life story. The lawsuit was dismissed in June 2006.\n\nThis Is Me... Then is the third full-length English studio album (fourth overall) by American singer Jennifer Lopez, released on November 19, 2002 by Epic Records. The album debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 selling 314,000 copies during its first week, remaining in the top twenty for twelve weeks and on the chart for thirty-seven weeks. It has sold 2.5 million copies in the United States and over six million copies worldwide.\n\nThe album spawned four singles: the old school hip hop-influenced &quot;Jenny from the Block&quot; (featuring Styles P and Jadakiss), the Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper &quot;All I Have&quot; (featuring LL Cool J), and the soul-tinged tracks &quot;I'm Glad&quot; and &quot;Baby I Love U!&quot;. Lopez's cover version of Carly Simon's 1978 song &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; was released in Brazil, where it appeared on the soundtrack to the telenovela Mulheres Apaixonadas, whereas &quot;The One&quot; was released to radio stations in EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½charting at number forty-one on the Romanian Top 100 in mid-May 2003ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and Brazil.\n\nThe track &quot;Dear Ben&quot; was in reference to her then-fiance, actor Ben Affleck.\n\nJennifer Lynn Lopez (born July 24, 1969), often nicknamed J.Lo, is an American actress, singer, record producer, dancer, television personality, fashion designer and television producer.
