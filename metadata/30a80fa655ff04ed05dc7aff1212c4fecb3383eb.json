The screenplay\\ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s roots in Bob Meyers\\ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original play are clear. The movie is also understated, leaving some of the work to your imagination. I like this in a movie, but others might find it unsatisfying. This understatement allows a delightful kind of organic humor to creep in from time to time, and allows suspense to build as well. Good job with this quirky directing style!\n\n\n\nSource: Drunkboat.2010.720p.BluRay.x264-SAiMORNY\nSize: 702.21 MB (736,323,404 bytes)\nGenre: Drama\nVideo: 861 Kbps | 720x400\nAudio: English | AC3 | 2Ch | 128 Kbps\n\nSubs: None\nIMDB Rating: 7.4/10 from 61 users\nRT Critics: N/A\nDirected By: Bob Meyer\nStarring: Dana Delany, Brian Deneen and John Goodman\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.sceper.eu/images/d2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.sceper.eu/images/d2.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.sceper.eu/images/d4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.sceper.eu/images/d4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30a80fa655ff04ed05dc7aff1212c4fecb3383eb","amp;dn":"Drunkboat+2010+BRRIP+X264+AC3+CrEwSaDe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30a80fa655ff04ed05dc7aff1212c4fecb3383eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,168,15,166,85,255,4,237,5,220,122,255,18,18,196,254,203,51,131,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
