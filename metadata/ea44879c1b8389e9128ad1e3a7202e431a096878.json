(see Note below)\n\n  When a young girl mysteriously disappears, a devoutly religious police sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) travels to the remote scottish island of Summerisle to investigate. But this pastoral community led by the strange Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) is not what it seems as the christian detective soon uncovers a secret society of wanton lust and pagan blasphemy. With phallic symbols and soothing music at every turn, Summerisle is a pleasant haven for those who perform the pagan rituals of their ancestors. The earthy ceremonies and tempting eroticism is fully expressed by the landlord's daughter (Britt Ekland), who fills Howie with barely suppressed carnal desire.\n\nNote: The movie was originaly supposed to be 102 minutes long, but was cut to 88 min. An extended version (95 min. long) was released a few years ago. But this is the version we all saw in the theater and the version that made this such a cult classic.\n\n  Starring: Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee, Diane Cilento, Britt Ekland, Ingrid Pitt.\n\n  Directed by: Robin Hardy.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 28min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 400\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea44879c1b8389e9128ad1e3a7202e431a096878","amp;dn":"The+Wicker+Man+%281975%29+%28Edward+Woodward%2C+Christopher+Lee%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea44879c1b8389e9128ad1e3a7202e431a096878","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,68,135,156,27,131,137,233,18,138,209,227,167,32,46,67,26,9,104,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
