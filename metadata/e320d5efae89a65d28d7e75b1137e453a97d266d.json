Married nearly 30 years, Doug and Lois rarely talk. She doesn't leave their Indianapolis home, and she's ordered a gravestone with their names and birth years on it. He has a long-time Thursday night mistress whom he invites to go with him to a plumbing supply conference in New Orleans. Once there, Doug calls Lois to say he's staying for a while. What's he leaving behind and what's he looking for in New Orleans? And Lois, can she break out.&quot;\n\n=========================================================================\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1183923/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1183923/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e320d5efae89a65d28d7e75b1137e453a97d266d","amp;dn":"Wel.the.rileys.2010+-+arabic+subs+hardcoded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e320d5efae89a65d28d7e75b1137e453a97d266d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,32,213,239,174,137,166,93,40,215,231,91,17,55,228,83,169,125,38,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
