I have included Team Blackbolt&amp;#039;s MC360 Skin, and have pre-installed Manturafs&amp;#039; LiveMark Mod, enabling an Unofficial XBMCLive Marketplace. There are lots of other options available as well. So, Hopefully you all enjoy. Also, extract the LiveContent folder to your E: drive. That way, when you DL new trainers from Marketplace, they&amp;#039;ll all be in the same place.\n\n*************************************************************************************************************\n*************************************************************************************************************\n                                     Xbox Media Center CHANGELOG\n************************************************************************************************************* \n*************************************************************************************************************\n\nadded/fixed: (dd-mm-yyyy) (please specify date in CET)\n - 07-10-2006 updated: Russian language file (Thnx to que_)\n - 07-10-2006 updated: Portuguese (Brazil) language file (Thnx to mvbm)\n - 07-10-2006 updated: Hungarian language file (Thnx to sigismund)\n - 07-10-2006 updated: Hebrew language file (Thnx to ookladek)\n - 07-10-2006 updated: Dutch language file (Thnx to MrNice)\n - 06-10-2006 fixed: Setting of viewport (for cropping scrolling text etc.) was not rotated correctly.
