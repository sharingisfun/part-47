The Complete Series.  I could not find this on TPB a few weeks ago so I got it from elsewhere and figured I would share it.  This is my first torrent.  I can't think of a better show to pop my torrent-cherry with.\n\nRipped from DVD using good ol' DVD Shrink with no compression.  Used Handbrake to transcode to H.264 .mkv container with decomb filter on at constant quality 20.  I think the file size for quality ratio is good.  Each episode is about 200MB\n\nEnjoy!\nMasta-Ro","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:002a97c49b96b9a722f9e1f10bd355489ed5f55c","amp;dn":"Chef%21+The+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"002a97c49b96b9a722f9e1f10bd355489ed5f55c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,42,151,196,155,150,185,167,34,249,225,241,11,211,85,72,158,213,245,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
