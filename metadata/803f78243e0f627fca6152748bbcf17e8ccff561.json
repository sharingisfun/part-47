His most outstanding credit is Burning Spear's Marcus Garvey album, and he also worked with Big Youth, the Heptones, the Gaylads, and Justin Hinds, among numerous other acts. The Black Foundation -- with Robbie Shakespeare, Horsemouth Wallace, Ansel Collins and others, the team that helped Burning Spear craft some of his best roots albums, are on all these tracks. This has 7 vocal tracks extended with their dub version plus 7 dub tracks whose vocal tracks arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t included.
