WYSIWYG Web Builder is a WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) program used to create web pages. WYSIWYG means that the finished page will display exactly the way it was designed. The program generates HTML (HyperText Markup Language) tags while you point and click on desired functions; you can create a web page without learning HTML. Just drag and drop objects to the page position them 'anywhere' you want and when you're finished publish it to your web server (using the build in Publish tool). Web Builder gives you full control over the content and layout of your web page. With the 'Standard Tools' toolbar you can execute basic commands like Create a new web site, Open an existing web site, Save, Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo. It also has icons to insert or edit hyperlinks (9th icon from the left) or add special characters when you're in text edit mode. The last two icons are for previewing and publishing.\nYou can easily add new browsers to use for preview using the 'Edit Browser List' option.\n\nNew in version 7.0:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Version 7.0 has more than 150 new features and improvements, please read this announcement for all the details.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ jQuery Accordion, Tabs, Dialog, DatePicker, AutoComplete, jQuery Button\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Site Search, easily add site search functionality to your website.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ News Viewer object.
