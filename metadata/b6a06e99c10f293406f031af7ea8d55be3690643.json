The film is a behind the scenes look\nat the underground movement of people who want to expose &quot;global elitists,&quot;\nwhom they claim are covertly masterminding a series of destructive events to\ncause a mass breakdown of the world's economy and society. Once the world has\nfallen into chaos, these same &quot;elitists&quot; will offer a plan to rebuild the\neconomic and social structure of the world (to their liking). This theory is\nalso known as the New World Order.\n\nThe film captures this growing anti-New World Order movement as it targets the\nannual Bilderberg conference, and the 9/11 attacks as focal points in the\nalleged global conspiracy. Alex Jones, a celebrity radio host, and underground\ncult hero, is the central character of the film. The film chronicles Alex and\nfour other conspiracy theorists on their ceaseless quest to expose the &quot;massive\nglobal conspiracy&quot; they believe threatens the future of humanity.\n\nNew World Order is a film about people who believe in conspiracy theories and\nwhy they believe in them, not about the theories themselves. This film does not\ntry to prove or disprove conspiracy theories. At its core, New World Order is a\nfilm about the power of ideas, and the power of ideas to change one's life and\ndefine one's actions.\n\n\n===\n\nMy DVD version is still available at:\nhttp://isohunt.com/torrent_details/77069373/IFC+NEW+WORLD+ORDER\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6a06e99c10f293406f031af7ea8d55be3690643","amp;dn":"IFC+-+NEW+WORLD+ORDER+%282009%29+XviD+tiny+rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6a06e99c10f293406f031af7ea8d55be3690643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,160,110,153,193,15,41,52,6,240,49,175,126,168,213,91,227,105,6,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
