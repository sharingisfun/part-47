Also, the sample rate is different from\n       the other tracks in the rip. This is not my fault, Nintendo recorded\n       them that way. Upsampling would result in quality loss and bigger file\n       sizes.\n       Track 47 is a prerecorded sound file that had the sound effects\n       included. There is no way to have the track without.\n       The SE Collection tracks are not recognised as music by the game's\n       sound driver. They are disabled when the sound effects are muted, as\n       such, I put them as &quot;x8-XX&quot; tracks.\n       Available track titles are taken from the &quot;Nintendo Sound History\n       Series Zelda the Music&quot; CD. I found additional official titles on some\n       Japanese sites. Those tracks could be downloaded via mobile phone\n       through Nintendo's mobile service and are not included on the official\n       soundtrack release (but they are of course in the rip).\n\nCredits: Many thanks to hcs who wrote a small application to automatically\n         zero out files! He's also the one who gave me the hint on how to\n         disable the sound effects.\n\nUpdates and corrections: Minor tag fix done in this re-release.\n                         &quot;Sword Level Up Fanfare&quot; should really be called\n                         &quot;Sword Level-Up Fanfare&quot;, as Nintendo officially\n                         gives the translation of &quot;ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â«ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã¢â‚¬â€&quot; as &quot;Level-Up&quot;\n                         in the manual of the Collector's Edition.\n\n\nGreetings, Prime Blue\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat would be the readme, if TPB weren't dumbtards that didn't allow any .txt's in their audio section. :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5cdbe6a8693fa2c45f4fac7d6a4972c59eb972f","amp;dn":"Zelda+Four+Swords+Adventure+GameRip+OST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5cdbe6a8693fa2c45f4fac7d6a4972c59eb972f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,205,190,106,134,147,250,44,69,244,250,199,214,164,151,44,89,235,151,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
