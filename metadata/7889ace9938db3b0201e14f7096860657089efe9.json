(its seen by windows as a DEVICE , \nnot a \\&quot;partition\\&quot; or \\&quot;virtual\\&quot; or \\&quot;fake\\&quot; drive) \ncan perform autorun on ENABLED winXP systems,\nremovable DEVICES with a writeable filesystem \n(like FAT and NTFS) can NOT !!\n The windows CD autorun function can execute ANY program\nspecified in the autorun.inf file provided it knows the path.\n\nTo provide instant autorun and access to\nthe GnU3zer LauncPad on BOTH drives the GnU3zer.ISO\nprovided uses a .vbs script,located on the CD,\ncalled \\&quot;go.vbs\\&quot; to search for a file called \\&quot;\\\\WIP\\\\CMD\\\\go.cmd\\&quot;\non the flash-drive and executes it when found.\n\\&quot;go.cmd\\&quot;then executes any program specified,\nin the GnU3zer iso provided it calls nircmd.exe\nto run PStart from the flash-drive.\nThis method allows you to customize the autorun feature\nas you like even if you decide NOT to use PStart on the\nflash-device.Simply add line(s) with the command(s) \nyou want nircmd to execute and save the file.\n(thanks to all the people at www.hack5.org for this one)\n\n[IMG]http://img157.imageshack.us/img157/3850/cdexpanduy0.jpg[/IMG]The GnU3zer CD \nwith expanded menu\n\n\nThe GnU3zer LaunchPad can run ANY portable program you want,\nincluding all of John T Hallers excellent apps\n(www.portableapps.com).\nYou can use it as a security-tool to (auto)mount encrypted TrueCrypt\nvolumes on you PC ( 50 key-files are included on the CD or use any other file on it.better:generate your own and put them in the ISO)\nSave your passwords in a KeePass .db encrypted file etc etc etc.\n\n[IMG]http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/1310/traynj0.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIncluded on the CD is Liberta AutoStart ,a NICE (and NEW) drive-tool.\nIt provides tray-icons for each removable drive including\nmounted TrueCrypt volumes and removable usb-HDD!!,the EJECT-DRIVE function and right click context-menu with program access etc..\n\n[IMG]http://img157.imageshack.us/img157/7950/libertarightclicpx6.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIf you LEFT-CLIC the drive-icon it will launch the app specified\nby \\&quot;shell=ProgramName\\&quot; in the \\&quot;autorun.inf\\&quot; in the drive-root.\nThis allows you to drop \\&quot;go.vbs\\&quot; if you dont like that rather\nscript-kiddie way of doing it and only have PStart (and all\nits \\&quot;run on start\\&quot; \\&amp;#039;run on exit\\&quot; options) one click away.\n\nYou will also find the famous \\&quot;HP-Format tool\\&quot;\nthis may not be a \\&quot;free\\&quot; program :) ) \nthat allows you to format your stick as bootable.\nIt is recommended to use FAT(16) or FAT32 unless you REALY\nneed the functions of NTFS.This should cause less wear on the \nflash-RAM.\nIf you use TrueCrypt encrypted drives NTFS should not be used.\n\nIts my hope that this torrent will inspire people to try\nout what the U3 drive can do . \nFeedback , tips and ideas are wellcome......\n\nKnown issues : PStart on the CD does not auto-close.\nTrueCrypt requires Admin-priv OR that an Admin ran the program\nonce.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7889ace9938db3b0201e14f7096860657089efe9","amp;dn":"GnU3zer+U3+LaunchPad+replacement","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7889ace9938db3b0201e14f7096860657089efe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,137,172,233,147,141,179,176,32,30,20,247,9,104,96,101,112,137,239,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
