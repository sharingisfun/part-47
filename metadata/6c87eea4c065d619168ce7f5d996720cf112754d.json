It's a hell of a find. The salvage rights alone could be worth a fortune. And by the law of the sea, any vessel discovered on international waters can be claimed by whomever is fortunate enough to find her and skilled enough to haul her back to port. But once on board the eerie, cavernous ship, the crew of the Arctic Warrior discovers that the decaying vessel is anything but deserted. It's home to something more deadly and horrific than anything they've encountered in all their years at sea.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c87eea4c065d619168ce7f5d996720cf112754d","amp;dn":"Ghost+Ship+%282002%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c87eea4c065d619168ce7f5d996720cf112754d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,135,238,164,192,101,214,25,22,140,231,245,217,150,114,12,241,18,117,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
