I have included these.  I also included the bonus tracks on the two 'studio albums' that were only on the Japanese releases.\n\nThe albums that had many artists on I only included the PatD songs.\n\nAll songs are tagged with 'PatD' as a contributing artist so that you can play everything with only selecting one artist.  Easy for iPods and such.\n\nThe 'String Tributes' are not PatD, they are various artists doing the 'studio albums' in a string quartet.\n\nThe album 'Live' is NOT an Album they released, it is simply a collection of all their live covers that weren't on other albums that I made.\n\nNot all albums were 'big' releases so it's hard to find info on them.\n\nSome of these albums were distributed ONLY to radio stations.\n\nI tagged all the songs with ID3 tags AND PUT LYRICS in for iTunes/iPods.\n\nI have also included album arts for everything.\n\nI am still missing rare recordings of Iwsnt and bgtwt, and the radio edit for nita and Iwsnt, but I should get them soon.\n\nAlso I couldn't find the live version of Intermission for 'Live In Denver' so I subbed the album version.  If you have it let me know.\n##########\n\n\n&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\nIf You Have Something I'm missing Please Share!\n&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\n\n\nIncludes Albums:\n\n   A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\n   A Fever You Can't Sweat Out - 5 Song Advance\n   AAA Sampler\n   Build God Then We'll Talk\n   But It's Better If You Do\n   But It's Better If You Do - Vinyl\n   I Write Sins Not Tragedies\n   I Write Sins Not Tragedies - Promo\n   I Write Sins Not Tragedies - Vinyl\n   Live\n   **Live In Chicago(AS SOON AS IT'S OUT I'LL ADD IT)\n   Live In Denver\n   Live Session (iTunes Exclusive)\n   Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off - Vinyl\n   Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off, Pt. 1\n   Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off, Pt. 2\n   Myspace - Tribute Album\n   Nine In The Afternoon - Promo\n   Nine In The Afternoon - Vinyl\n   Nine In The Afternoon\n   Pretty.
