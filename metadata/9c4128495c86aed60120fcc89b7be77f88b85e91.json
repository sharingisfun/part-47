When a museum accident transports Ally on an adverture back in time to explore the terrain and territory of life-size dinosaurs she is thrust literally nose-to-nose with the largest and most realistic dinosaur ever to appear on a movie screen - the fearsome 20-foot tall 15-ton Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\nBrett Leonard directed this 3-D Imax short feature (running 45 minutes) about a famous paleontologist's teen daughter, who's able to enter into the world of the dinosaurs. In Alberta, Canada, Dr. Donald Hayden (Peter Horton) and his assistant Elizabeth (Kari Coleman) find a Tyrannosaurus egg.\n\nDonald's daughter Ally (Liz Stauber) hopes the egg will prove her theory that dinosaurs were ancestors of present-day birds. Back at their museum, Ally knocks the egg on the floor, loosening some strange dust. At night, a T-rex skeleton springs to life, and Ally discovers she can use museum exhibits as a springboard for time travel, encountering famed dinosaur illustrator Charles Knight (Tuck Milligan) and paleontologist Barnum Brown (Laurie Murdoch). She also sees a flying Pteranodon, an Ornithomimus and other creatures -- which all become extinct in the meteoric conclusion.\n\n\n\n\nDirected by:  Brett Leonard\n---------------------------\n\n\n\nTitle: T-Rex Back To The Cretaceous\nYear:  1998\nFile Size: 402 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:45:30\nVideo Codec: DivX3\nVideo Resolution: 480x352\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1235 kbit/s\nFPS:  23.976215\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (N/A)\n \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163862/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163862/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c4128495c86aed60120fcc89b7be77f88b85e91","amp;dn":"T-Rex+Back+To+The+Cretaceous-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c4128495c86aed60120fcc89b7be77f88b85e91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,65,40,73,92,134,174,214,1,32,252,200,155,123,231,127,136,184,94,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
