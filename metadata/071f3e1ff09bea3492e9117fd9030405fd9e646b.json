Eko walks through it, very aware he was responsible for his brother&amp;#039;s death.He finds Yemi&amp;#039;s Bible and a photo of them as kids tucked between its pages.He is interrupted by Amina, who asks about Father Yemi.Eko tells her he is taking Yemi&amp;#039;s place.Amina introduces her son, Daniel, who is an altar boy in the church.\n\nOutside, they hear gun shots.It&amp;#039;s Emeka and his gang who demand the vaccine.Amina tells them it&amp;#039;ll arrive on Friday.She explains that the clinic gets ten percent of the vaccine, and Emeka and his gang get the rest as payment for protection.Eko isn&amp;#039;t afraid of Emeka, so Emeka shoots and kills a random woman.Eko is angry but keeps quiet so he doesn&amp;#039;t blow his cover.Emeka promises to return for the vaccine.\n\nOn the island, Eko stumbles through the jungle, dehydrated and delirious.He sees Emeka and his men, bloody and butchered.Then he sees Daniel, who tells him to confess.He stumbles to a stream for water.While he&amp;#039;s drinking, he hears the smoke monster and sees its reflection looming menacingly behind him. \n\n\n\n==================================\n\n\nEPISODE 306 \n\nI Do\nWe open with a flashback -- Kate checks into a hotel room and looks at her wedding veil.A policeman knocks on the door and demands to be let in.Is she going to be arrested?When Kate opens the door, she jumps into his arms -- they&amp;#039;re a couple! Kate is marrying a cop.Kate has a moment of doubt, but Kevin assures her it&amp;#039;s right and real because he loves her.\n\nOn the island, Jack checks Ben&amp;#039;s x-rays and medical file.He tells Ben the tumor will be inoperable in about a week and he needs to be in surgery immediately -- but Jack won&amp;#039;t do the surgery.He told Ben this so he would know how he&amp;#039;s going to die.\n\nLocke tells Nikki, Paulo, Sayid and Desmond that Eko was killed by an animal.Sayid doesn&amp;#039;t believe him.When they&amp;#039;re alone, Sayid asks Locke what really killed Eko.Locke says people call it the monster but he doesn&amp;#039;t believe in monsters.Locke believes it may be what brought them there and that Eko died for a reason -- he just doesn&amp;#039;t know what it is yet.\n\nWhile Kate and Sawyer are working, a warning sounds -- it&amp;#039;s a compound breach. Suddenly Alex runs out of the jungle holding a slingshot and firing rocks, demanding to know where her boyfriend is.She&amp;#039;s grabbed from behind and taken off.She shouts to Kate that they&amp;#039;ll kill her boyfriend, meaning Sawyer, just like they killed hers.\n\nJuliet tells Kate that Pickett is going to kill Sawyer, but if Kate can convince Jack to do the operation, Kate can save Sawyer&amp;#039;s life.When Jack and Kate see each other, emotion overcomes them.Kate hates being used but she tells Jack he has to do the operation.Jack is mad she believes the Others...and mad that she&amp;#039;s there asking him to save Sawyer&amp;#039;s life.\n\nFlashback to Kate, nervous before her wedding.Kevin&amp;#039;s mom, Suzanne, gives her a beautiful gold locket her mom had given her.Kate tells her mother-in-laws aren&amp;#039;t supposed to be so nice.During the ceremony, the Minister talks about Kate&amp;#039;s honesty and faithfulness, and how what you see is what you get.But Kevin, Suzanne and the Minister think Kate&amp;#039;s name is Monica, and Kate is aware of the irony of those words. \n\n\n\n====================================\n\n\nEPISODE 307 \n\nNot in Portland\n&quot;Kate, dammit, RUN!&quot;\n\nWith Ben bleeding out on the operation table, Jack stops the surgery to give Kate and Sawyer enough time to escape.Juliet orders Ivan to bring them back - to kill them if necessary.Jack warns her he&amp;#039;ll let Ben die.Jack tells Friendly that Juliet asked him to kill Ben.Juliet denies it.Friendly orders Juliet to leave the room.\n\nKate and Sawyer make it to the shore but realize they need a boat.With Pickett, Jason and Ivan hot on their trail, they run back into the jungle to hide.They meet Alex, who hides them in a camouflaged tiger pit.Alex tells them she has a boat they can use - but only if they help rescue her boyfriend, Karl.\n\nFLASHBACK to Juliet in Miami.She visits her sister, and in the hallway passes Ethan Rom.He says hello but Juliet doesn&amp;#039;t know him.Juliet wakes Rachel and gives her an injection.Rachel has lost her hair from chemotherapy, so what&amp;#039;s the injection Juliet gives her?A cancer drug?Juliet tells Rachel they can stop if she wants.Rachel asks her if she&amp;#039;s worried if Edmund Burke, Juliet&amp;#039;s ex-husband who runs the research lab, will find out.
