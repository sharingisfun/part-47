No one equaled his talent for presenting viewers with stories of murder, mystery and the macabre that had an unforeseen kick in the &quot;tale&quot;.\n\nWith the format being limited to short story-telling, rather than progress to an Eighth Season of the half-hour series, Hitchcock returned with an expanded format titled THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK HOUR. Stories were given more scope, but all the hallmarks viewers had come to love remained faithful and the series went from strength to strength running a further three years.\n\nNow, for the first time anywhere, the entire deliciously murderous Second Season of THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK HOUR is available on DVD - all 32 stories presented by the master of suspense himself. Join an incredible whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who of guest stars including Christopher Lee, Martin Landau, Ray Milland, Bob Newhart, Leslie Nielsen, Anne Baxter, Robert Culp, Gloria Swanson, Darren McGavin, Roddy McDowall, George Segal, Bruce Dern, John Cassavetes, Dick York, Lillian Gish, Robert Loggia and many more as they become the puppets in HitchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theatre.\n\nVoted as one of &quot;The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time&quot; by Time magazine, tune in once more to the master storyteller with some of the most deliciously wicked and chilling television ever aired and discover why THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK HOUR remains one of the most beloved series ever made. \n\nDISC 1:\n------\n1 &quot;A Home Away from Home&quot; (Ray Milland)\n2 &quot;A Nice Touch&quot; (Anne Baxter, George Segal)\n3 &quot;Terror in Northfield&quot; (Dick York, Jacqueline Scott, R.G.
