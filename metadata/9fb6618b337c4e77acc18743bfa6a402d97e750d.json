Could be considered a comprehensive guide for trip-hop starters, but, moreover, it is a serious anthology. Few could believe the selection was very strict, but the truth is that there are actually bands that were close to getting into this final cut: Watch the Men Fall, Smoke City, Passion Flower, Abraham, Blue Tofu, Bows, Aloan and the list could continue. Still, I&amp;#039;m glad with the selection: it should be the end to all arguments that trip-hop was ephemere, not very productive and without notable artists other than Portishead and Massive Attack.\nKeep on tripping!\n\n\ntracklisting:\n1.
