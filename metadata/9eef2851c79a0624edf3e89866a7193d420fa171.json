These three are NOT your typical pilots. Each with their own crop dusting operations, they are competitive, ego driven daredevils, choosing coveralls over pressed uniforms and 'flying tractors' over jets. These crop-gun pilots buzz inches above the fields ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ dodging trees and telephone wires ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to deliver their payloads while entertaining roadside audiences with their death-defying feats. With high stakes drama on the ground and peril in the air, Dust Up features compelling stories about family feuds, resourcefulness and survival in the rural heartland.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9eef2851c79a0624edf3e89866a7193d420fa171","amp;dn":"Dust+Up+Season+01+Ep01-06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9eef2851c79a0624edf3e89866a7193d420fa171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,239,40,81,199,154,6,36,237,243,232,152,102,167,25,61,66,15,161,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
