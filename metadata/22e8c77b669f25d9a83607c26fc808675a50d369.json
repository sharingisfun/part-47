After beginning her career as a child actress on Australian television, she achieved recognition through her role in the television soap opera Neighbours, before commencing her career as a recording artist in 1987. Her first single, &quot;Locomotion&quot;, spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart and became the highest selling single of the decade. This led to a contract with songwriters and producers Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman. Her debut album, Kylie (1988), and the single &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot;, each reached number one in the United Kingdom, and over the next two years, her first 13 singles reached the British top ten. Her debut film, The Delinquents (1989) was a box-office hit in Australia and the UK despite negative reviews.\n\nInitially presented as a &quot;girl next door&quot;, Minogue attempted to convey a more mature style in her music and public image. Her singles were well received, but after four albums her record sales were declining, and she left Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman in 1992 to establish herself as an independent performer. Her next single, &quot;Confide in Me&quot;, reached number one in Australia and was a hit in several European countries in 1994, and a duet with Nick Cave, &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot;, brought Minogue a greater degree of artistic credibility. Drawing inspiration from a range of musical styles and artists, Minogue took creative control over the songwriting for her next album, Impossible Princess (1997). It failed to attract strong reviews or sales in the UK, but was successful in Australia.\n\nMinogue returned to prominence in 2000 with the single &quot;Spinning Around&quot; and the dance-oriented album Light Years, and she performed during the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Her music videos showed a more sexually provocative and flirtatious personality and several hit singles followed. &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; reached number one in more than 40 countries, and the album Fever (2001) was a hit throughout the world, including the United States, a market in which Minogue had previously received little recognition. Minogue embarked on a concert tour but cancelled it when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005. After surgery and chemotherapy treatment, she resumed her career in 2006 with Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour. Her tenth studio album X was released in 2007 and was followed by the KylieX2008 tour. In 2009, she embarked upon her For You, for Me Tour, her first concert tour of the US and Canada.\n\nAlthough she was dismissed by some critics, especially during the early years of her career, she has achieved worldwide record sales of more than 68 million, and has received notable music awards, including multiple ARIA and Brit Awards and a Grammy Award. She has mounted several successful concert tours and received a Mo Award for &quot;Australian Entertainer of the Year&quot; for her live performances. She was awarded an OBE &quot;for services to music&quot;, and an Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22e8c77b669f25d9a83607c26fc808675a50d369","amp;dn":"Kylie+Minogue+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22e8c77b669f25d9a83607c26fc808675a50d369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,232,199,123,102,159,37,217,168,54,7,194,111,200,8,103,90,80,211,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
