While this might be deemed foolhardy in some circles, the fact that Hansen pulls it off makes it hard to not admire the effort in its entirety.\n\n&quot;Killer Me&quot; is a classic character study of a character who is anything but classic -- a serial killer. The obvious comparisons here are to films like &quot;Clean, Shaven&quot; or &quot;Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,&quot; though &quot;Killer Me&quot; is filtered through a different voice and a different set of perceptions which are, in many ways, more challenging and more subjectively disturbing than either previous film. Stylized by not ostentatiously stylistic, &quot;Killer Me&quot; plants viewers so firmly inside the mind of its subject -- beautifully played by George Foster -- that the style itself almost becomes invisibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\nNo, not everyone is going to enjoy &quot;Killer Me.&quot; It's not even clear if the movie is meant to be &quot;enjoyed&quot; at all in any conventional sense. What is clear is that &quot;Killer Me&quot; manifests a distinctive, uncompromising and imaginative voice at a time when originality and distinctiveness are becoming less and less appreciated.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - Wade Major, Box Office Online \n\n-----\n\nnot my rip.
