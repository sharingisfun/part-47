Which is a shame.\n\nBut The Pirate Bay should prove to be an excellent resource for others to upload their existing Earthcomber .pdb files for the benefit of those who still prefer to use their trusty gps enabled pdas.\n\nThese files are tried and proven on Palm OS 5.0 devices, but feel free to upload any and all Earthcomber map files, along with specific compatibility as well as installation information. And don't hesitate to provide feedback, for the benefit of all.\n\nInstallation:\n - Download the zipped file, for each area/region.\n      Be sure to select the &quot;(GET TORRENT FILE)&quot; or &quot;(ANONYMOUS DOWNLOAD)&quot; option.\n      Avoid the &quot;DOWNLOAD&quot; box. \n - Each zipped file contains two .pdb (Palm Database) files: \n      CitySTATE and CitySTATE_loc files. \n - Open up the zipped file and copy both files directly to the pda SD card:\n      SD card/PALM/Launcher.\n - And that's all there is to it. Enjoy!\n\nLikewise, please copy any and all of your Earthcomber .pdb map files, off the pda SD card, and upload the The Pirate Bay.\nLikewise, feel free to upload Earthcomber USA map files designed for other pdas and operating systems, as well as specific instructions as how to install.\n\nNote: Earthcomber USA ended support for these pda gps map downloads around 2010, and the data on these maps is probably much older. So use discretion.\n      Earthcomber only produced maps for the United States.\n\nI have uploaded, or will soon upload the following maps of my existing inventory:\n   (11 maps = 22 files on your palm pda)\n   Alameda, California (AlamedaCA + AlamedaCA_loc)\n   Contra Costa County, California (Contra CostaCA + ContraCostaCA_loc)\n   Mariposa, California (MariposaCA + MariposaCA_loc)\n   Napa, California (NapaCA + NapaCA_loc)\n   New York, New York (New YorkNY + NewYorkNY_loc)\n   San Francisco, California (San FranciscoCA + SanFranciscoCA_loc)\n   Santa Clara, California (Santa ClaraCA + SantaClaraCA_loc)\n   Santa Cruz, California (Santa CruzCA + SantaCruzCA_loc)\n   Siskiyou, California (SiskiyouCA + SiskiyouCA_loc) \n   Solano, California (SolanoCA + SolanoCA_loc) \n   Tulare, California (TulareCA + TulareCA_loc)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d939d07ad4a7a7a21512b2742dbd2caaec881982","amp;dn":"Earthcomber+map+for+Palm+pda+-+New+York%2C+New+York","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d939d07ad4a7a7a21512b2742dbd2caaec881982","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,57,208,122,212,167,167,162,21,18,178,116,45,189,44,170,236,136,25,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
