ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an inappropriate flight for anyone with claustrophobia, nyctophobia, fear of noise, fear of air pressure, and fear of corpses. All terror is waiting for one unlucky air hostesses who will face this alone.\n\nDeadly Charm (by Phavee Purijidpanya)\n\nImagine a childish payback like write a joke about your friendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s parents on the blackboard. Then imagine a payback of vocational schoolboys who curse people they hate on a deadly charm. LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s see how excruciating these curses will bring to the table.\n\nThe Middle Man (by Banjong Pisanthanakun\n\nA group of teenagers is camping in the wood. They think itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be fun to tell a scary story while mocking what a character will act in the horror movies. Unfortunately, the mystic ghosts they encounter are those that go against the grain of traditional rules in horror films.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e669c37337eee7d161293e8aede00f34b94c13b9","amp;dn":"%5BThai+Movie%5D+Phobia+%284+Praeng%29+-+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e669c37337eee7d161293e8aede00f34b94c13b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,105,195,115,55,238,231,209,97,41,62,138,237,224,15,52,185,76,19,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
