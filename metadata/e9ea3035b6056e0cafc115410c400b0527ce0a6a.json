Outside The Wall\n\n\nThe Wall, Pink Floyd's 1979 concept album about a rock star's mental breakdown, is a towering monster. It was inspired by then-bandleader Roger Waters' own mental collapse at the end of the Floyd's tour for the Animals album. The Wall tells the story of a rock star named Pink and his downward spiral into madness, and all the things in his life that led him there: his father killed in the war when he was only a baby, being smothered by his overbearing mother, subjected to abuse at school, and later, the pressures of his rock-star lifestyle and the breakdown of his marriage. Quite simply, The Wall is a rock masterwork, and arguably Roger Waters' greatest achievement as a composer.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 53\nArtist: Pink Floyd\nAlbum: The Wall\nYear: 1979\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd, booklet\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9ea3035b6056e0cafc115410c400b0527ce0a6a","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+The+Wall+%5BFLAC-1979%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9ea3035b6056e0cafc115410c400b0527ce0a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,234,48,53,182,5,110,12,175,193,21,65,12,64,11,5,39,206,10,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
