This is a personal collection from my computer, it contains only the best of the best. I have lived most of my life in the Kurdistan parts of Iran and Iraq and I know *something* about good Eastern music.\n\nMost of the files have proper ID3 tags, so don't worry about the file names.\n\nPS: I am sending these files to a friend and using TPB as the tracker. I guarantee that the music files work. But please kindly do not download the books and the diaries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b00d2f00eb3c9565bc7daae67c43d9a54baca8c9","amp;dn":"Personal+collection+of+Arabic%2C+Kurdish+and+Farsi+music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b00d2f00eb3c9565bc7daae67c43d9a54baca8c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,13,47,0,235,60,149,101,188,125,170,230,124,67,217,165,75,172,168,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
