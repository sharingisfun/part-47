The song is released as the fourth single and fourth track of their fourth album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦And Justice for All. Metallica won their first Grammy Award in 1990 for &quot;One&quot;, winning Best Metal Performance. &quot;One&quot; was also the band's first Top 40 hit single, peaking at #35 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n&quot;One&quot; was the first Metallica song for which a music video was created. The music video, directed by Bill Pope and Michael Salomon, debuted on MTV on January 20, 1989. The video, shot in Long Beach, CA, is almost entirely in black and white, and features the band performing the song in a warehouse. It features dialogue and several scenes from the 1971 film adaptation of Johnny Got His Gun. Timothy Bottoms can be seen starring as Joe Bonham, the main character in the novel.\n\nThree versions of the &quot;One&quot; music video were made; the first (the longest, album version) contained scenes of both the band and scenes from the movie. The second was simply a shortened version of the first and the third lacked scenes from the movie.\n\nLike many other music videos from Metallica, &quot;One&quot; puts great emphasis on the performances of the band members as musicians, with many shots of Hetfield, Newsted and Hammett's hands picking and fretting. The video features the band members in a typical early Metallica fashion: playing (as if in rehearsal) in some sort of warehouse, in tight formation around Ulrich's drum kit, and dressed in casual street clothes and with long untamed hair.\n\nIn the music video, it can be clearly seen that both Hetfield and Hammett are playing ESP guitars. It is also clear that Newsted is playing bass with his fingers at the start of the song, but later switches to a pick.\n\nTwo of the three versions of the &quot;One&quot; music video appear on 2 of One, a VHS released on July 1, 1990 and both would again be featured on the band's 2006 Music video compilation DVD.\n\nThe music video was ranked 38 on Rock on the Net: MTV: 100 Greatest Music Videos and number 1 on Fuse's No. 1 Countdown: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Special Edition.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27fc96f742c500050c2df28e58e69942dcbceed5","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+one++%28Short+version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27fc96f742c500050c2df28e58e69942dcbceed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,252,150,247,66,197,0,5,12,45,242,142,88,230,153,66,220,188,238,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
