They are both good friends with Brijnath (Paresh Rawal) who is not as wealthy. Rana's younger sister Madhu (Madhuri Dixit) is a good friend of Brijnath's younger brother Raja (Sanjay Kapoor). Seeing this Rana and Birju both arrange for Raja and Madhu to marry when they are older but Rana quickly backs out and insults Birju because of his social status. A accident causes Birju to become mental. Many years have passed and Raja and Madhu soon meet each other and fall in love. However Rana and Vishwa are determined to keep Madhu away from Raja. Eventually Rana gives in and accepts Raja into the family. When Raja leaves the city for a few days, Birju is invited to stay at the Garewal mansion. However, Madhu accuses Birju of rape when she is attacked by him. Rana immediately sends Birju to a mental hospital and Raja is forced to make a choice between his love and his brother. Believing in Birju innocence he breaks off his engagement with her. Madhu does not know that her own brothes had set Birju up so it looked like he had attacked her but in fact it was someone else who attacked her. Will Madhu find out what her brothers did? Will Raja be re-united with her?\n\n\n\nCast (in credits order)\n\tSanjay Kapoor\t... \tRaja\n\n\tMadhuri Dixit\t... \tMadhu Garewal\n\tMukesh Khanna\t... \tRana Mahednra Pratap Garewal\n\tDalip Tahil\t... \tVishwa Garewal\n\tRita Bhaduri\t... \tSarita Garewal\n\tMushtaq Khan\t... \tBanwarilal Sanyal\n\tAdi Irani\t... \tAbhishek Sanyal\n\tParesh Rawal\t... \tBrijnath 'Birju'\n\tSatyendra Kapoor\t... \tDoctor (as Satyen Kappu)\n\tHimani Shivpuri\t... \tKaki\n\tDinesh Hingoo\t... \tRonglani (as Dinesh Hingu)\n\tTiku Talsania\t... \tShantipati (as Tiku Talsaniya)\n\tAmita Nangia\t... \tNisha - Madhu's friend (as Amita Nagia)\n\tSudhir\t... \tPolice Inspector\n\tVeeru Krishnan\t... \tNeighbour-eunuch\n\tMaster Sunny\t... \tYoung Raja\n\tNamdev Lahute\t\t\n\tRauf Sholapurkar\t\t\n\tNaginder\t\t\n\tHarpal Singh\t... \tConstable Harpal (as Harpal)\n\tHarjeet Walia\t\t\n\tCharlie\t\t\n\tMimi\t\t\n\tBaby Gazala\t... \tYoung Madhu\n\nProduced by\nIndra Kumar\t.... \tproducer\nAshok Thakeria\t.... \tproducer\n \nOriginal Music by\nShravan Rathod\t \t(as Shravan)\nNadeem Saifi\t \t(as Nadeem)\nNaresh Sharma\t \t\n \nCinematography by\nBaba Azmi\t \t\n \nFilm Editing by\nHussain A.
