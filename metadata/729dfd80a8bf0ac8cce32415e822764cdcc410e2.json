Ditch your old antivirus software \nfor high-performance, next-gen antivirus + antispyware that IS NOT a resource hog.\n\nPC Magazine's security expert Neil Rubenking just gave VIPRE an excellent review \nwith 4 STARS and said: &quot;As its name indicates, Sunbelt Software's VIPRE Antivirus \n+ Antispyware 3.1 is designed to handle all kinds of malicious software, and it \ndoes a very thorough job.&quot; Robert Vamosi's CNET review of VIPRE said: &quot;7.8 out of \n10: Very Good. VIPRE combines antivirus and antispyware technology in a fast and \nlight application that also includes a worthy set of security tools.&quot; But spend a \nminute to find out what VIPRE can do for a home PC with old-style antivirus on it. \n\nRead this ZDNet review that starts out with: &quot;Sunbelt Software's VIPRE - I've \nfinally found an antivirus package that delivers the goods. Next, in a follow-up \npost he does a performance shoot-out and concludes: &quot;Sunbelt Software's claim \nthat VIPRE doesn't hog system resources and doesn't slow down a PC isn't just \nmarketing hyperbole but is actually true.&quot;\n\nHigh-performance, next-generation antivirus + antispyware software\nVIPRE combines antivirus, antispyware, anti-rootkit and other technologies into \na seamless, tightly-integrated product. Built with next-generation technology, \nVIPRE (Virus Intrusion Protection Remediation Engine) gives you powerful antivirus \nand antispyware software in-one that protects you against today's highly complex \nmalware threats including viruses, adware, spyware and rootkits, without hogging \nyour PC resources like many traditional antivirus products.\n\n\nCheckmark Anti-Virus Certified\nVIPRE is Checkmark Anti-Virus Desktop certified by West Coast Labs and will \nreceive additional certifications through other certifying bodies in the coming \nmonths.\n\nDoes not slow down your PC!\nUser surveys show the biggest frustration with existing antivirus solutions is \nbloat and high resource usage. VIPRE's design is low on system resources and \noptimizes your overall PC user experience, keeping notification pop-ups and \nwarnings to a minimum.\n\nReal-time monitoring with Active ProtectionG??\nVIPRE's Active Protection delivers real time monitoring and protection against \nknown and unknown malware threats. Active Protection works inside the Windows \nkernel (the core of the operating system), watching for malware and stopping it \nbefore it has a chance to execute on your system.\n\nFull protection against email-borne threats\nVIPRE includes comprehensive protection against email viruses, with direct \nsupport for Outlook, Outlook Express and Windows Mail; and support for any \nemail program that uses POP3 and SMTP.\n\nAdvantages of VIPRE Antivirus + Antispyware\n- High-performance threat protection with low impact on system resources\n- Scans email for malware threats\n- Kernel-level Active Protection guards you 24/7\n- Advanced anti-rootkit technologies\n- Small, regular definition updates greatly reduce update downloading time\n- VIPRE has three extra bonus tools: a history cleaner, a secure file eraser, \n  and the PC Explorer for advanced users. \n\nFind Out How Bad Old-style Antivirus Resource Usage Really Is.\nOld-style antivirus products have stacked layer upon layer of engines, and \ncreated bloatware in the process. They slow down your PC, have slow scan times \nand cause performance problems. See VIPRE's low impact on system resources \ncompared to the competition.

Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\nAlso scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware \ndetected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at Feb, 07 2009 - 19.15 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:729dfd80a8bf0ac8cce32415e822764cdcc410e2","amp;dn":"Sunbelt+VIPRE+Antivirus+%26+Antispyware+v3.1.2416+%2B+Patch+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"729dfd80a8bf0ac8cce32415e822764cdcc410e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,157,253,128,168,191,10,200,204,227,36,21,232,34,118,76,220,196,16,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
