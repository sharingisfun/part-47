(see ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“What is the Studio CutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ below)  Yes Ridley Scott shot the raw footage but the Studio editors made the cut and added voice over from Harrison Ford.  \n\nThis is a completely different film than the Directors Cut.  It has a different tone a much darker feel and has a different ending.\n\nWhat is the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Studio CutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢?\n\nThis is the first and original ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Blade RunnerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ with voice over by Harrison Ford.  No one has messed with it.  \nIf you want to know what happened read on.\n\nAt the time the studio gave a young and up coming director, Ridley Scott, an opportunity to make a film starring Harrison Ford and based on a novel By Philip Dick.  After shooting and editing the film Director Ridley Scott turned it over to the studio for release.\n\nUnfortunately, the studio did not like the Directors version of the book.  So they took the raw footage and re-cut it into this version asking Harrison Ford to do voice over story lines.\n\nYears later the now successful Director Ridley Scott bought the rights to the movie and every copy he could get his hands on.  He re-released it as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Directors CutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ he also released it only on the new digital medium DVD.  He did not release it on VHS, which was the popular medium of the day. As DVD was so new the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Studio CutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ was never released in a digital version.\n\nWhen Ridley Scott made his new version of Blade Runner and called it the Directors cut, it was the first time such a thing had been done.  The studios saw the possibility of making huge profits by re-releasing old movies with a bit of extra footage tacked on.  This however was a complete make over in fact it was said (and is ) that they are two different films.\n\nThis is for those of us who love the original version but cannot find it as it is out of print.  Mr. Scott refuses to publish the Studio Cut in a digital format so this is all we have.\n\nToemark.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:560c522dfdf1c9a050142e6605b97b41190fb329","amp;dn":"Blade+Runner+Studio+Cut+Collectors+Out+of+Print+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"560c522dfdf1c9a050142e6605b97b41190fb329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,12,82,45,253,241,201,160,80,20,46,102,5,185,123,65,25,15,179,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
