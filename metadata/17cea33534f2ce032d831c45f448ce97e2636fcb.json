Audiences embraced the mouse like no cartoon character before him. Overnight Mickey Mouse Clubs sprung up all over the world. But the success of Mickey came at a price. Because audiences cherished Mickey so much, the Disney animators were forced to tone down his wild behavior. Mickey became less &quot;funny&quot; and needed a band of crazy brothers to pick up the slack. One such sidekick was Goofy, perhaps the wildest and wackiest character in the entire Disney pantheon. Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Goofy a limited edition DVD set hosted by film historian Leonard Maltin, turns the spotlight on Mickey's favorite chum, thanks to Disney Home Entertainment.\n\n1939 - Goofy and Wilbur\n1940 - Goofy's Glider\n1941 - Baggage Buster.\n1941 - The Art of Self Defense.\n1941 - The Art of Skiing\n1942 - How to Fish.\n1942 - How to Play Baseball.\n1942 - How to Play Football\n1942 - How to Swim.\n1942 - The Olympic Champ.\n1943 - Victory Vehicles.\n1944 - How to be a Sailor.\n1944 - How to Play Golf.\n1945 - African Diary.\n1945 - Californy or Bust.\n1945 - Hockey Homicide.\n1945 - Tiger Trouble.\n1946 - Knight for a Day\n1947 - Double Dribble\n1947 - Foul Hunting.\n1948 - The Big Wash.\n1948 - They're Off.\n\nextras\nthe essential goof\nthe man behind the goof","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17cea33534f2ce032d831c45f448ce97e2636fcb","amp;dn":"Walt-Disneys-The-Complete+Goofy%5Bdisc+1%5D-1939-1948-xvids+by+Winke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17cea33534f2ce032d831c45f448ce97e2636fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,206,163,53,52,242,206,3,45,131,28,69,244,72,206,151,226,99,111,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
