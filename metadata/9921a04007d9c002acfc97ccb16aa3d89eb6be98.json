Mitch wants to meet with Andrew. Jump back two days. Mitch is defending one of his first clients, now accused of attempted murder but claiming he wasn't even there. The prosecution has DNA evidence, so Mitch advises against a &quot;not-there&quot; defense, then finds he's boxed himself into a corner. Is there any way he can help his client? Abbie revisits Moxon's widow; Tammy makes more calls to people on Moxon's list and finds more surprises. Thinking he's figured it out, Mitch goes to Sarah Holt to confront her. Will she finally help, or is she too burned out from war to defend herself?\n\n\nDetails\n********\n\nDirector:Helen Shaver\nWriters:John Grisham (novel), Lukas Reiter (creator)\nStars:Josh Lucas, Callum Keith Rennie and Molly Parker \nCountry:Canada\nLanguage:English\nSubs:External Greek srt\nRelease Date:24 March 2012 (USA)\n\nRatings: 7.4/10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9921a04007d9c002acfc97ccb16aa3d89eb6be98","amp;dn":"The+Firm+S01E12+HDTV+XviD-FQM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9921a04007d9c002acfc97ccb16aa3d89eb6be98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,33,160,64,7,217,192,2,172,252,151,204,177,106,163,216,158,182,190,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
