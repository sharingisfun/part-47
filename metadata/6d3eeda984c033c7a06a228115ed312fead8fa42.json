Scott Fitzgerald's novel, The Great Gatsby. The filmmaker will create his own distinctive visual interpretation of the classic story, bringing the period to life in a way that has never been seen before, in a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; follows Fitzgerald-like, would-be writer Nick Carraway as he leaves the Midwest and comes to New York City in the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz and bootleg kings. Chasing his own American Dream, Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby, and across the bay from his cousin, Daisy, and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan. It is thus that Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super-rich, their illusions, loves and deceits. As Nick bears witness, within and without the world he inhabits, he pens a tale of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and high-octane tragedy, and holds a mirror to our own modern times and struggles. \n\n\n\nSample: included\n\n\n\nRemember to seed or it will take for ever for everyone....\n\n\n\nSource: Realuploads-Production \nEncoder: Realuploads\nSynchronization check (Subs / sound):  Realuploads\nProofreading: Realuploads2\nSubs: The Riddle\n\n\n\nVideo\n\nType: MKV  (H.264 / AVC)\nOriginal duration:  02:22:19:38\nBitrate:  0.87 Mbps\nResolution:  1280x536\nFrame rate :  23,97 fps\nAspect Ratio:  160:67\nProfile:  High Profile\nFrame type:  Progressive\n\n\nAudio\n\nType: MP3\nSampling rate:  44kHz\nBitrate:  255Kbps\nChannel:  Stereo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d3eeda984c033c7a06a228115ed312fead8fa42","amp;dn":"The+Great+Gatsby+%28+Dk+subs+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d3eeda984c033c7a06a228115ed312fead8fa42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,62,237,169,132,192,51,199,160,106,34,129,21,237,49,47,234,216,250,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
