Definitely a hidden gem, been listening to it solidly for years now.\n\nI bought this from the band themselves after a show in Cleveland back in 2004.  It was a pre-release copy that got caught up in a legal battle and eventually ended up on Klayton (Celldweller)'s FiXT indie label in 2008.\n\nI think more people should check out this band.\n\nRemember, support independent music to keep the artists alive!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fixtstore.com/category/146/The-New-Slaves&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fixtstore.com/category/146/The-New-Slaves&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrackslisting:\n\n01: Biofilter\n02: Did you know\n03: I hope you die\n04: I know you know\n05: Razorblade Memories\n06: See the light\n07: Who do you think you are\n08: Never let go\n09: Nothing left\n10: Last regrets","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c132af51b6aa12888d3735154eecdfc68f9d628","amp;dn":"The+New+Slaves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c132af51b6aa12888d3735154eecdfc68f9d628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,19,42,245,27,106,161,40,136,211,115,81,84,238,205,252,104,249,214,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
