Starting in the ramshackle but romantic capital of Havana, he travels with ordinary Cubans, sharing anecdotes, life stories, and political opinions. Millar may not have all the answers but he asks a lot of the right questions on an anarchic, entertaining, and often comic adventure. A journey everyone will want to read about but nobody in their right mind would want to emulate! &quot;[A] charming, witty, but sometimes sad memoir that offers a portrait of a nation on the cusp of enormous change. . . An enjoyable, informative glimpse at a Cuba seldom seen by Americans.&quot;-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64fc7e551223065f414988016a156d5909a57846","amp;dn":"Slow+Train+To+Guantanamo+-+Peter+Millar.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64fc7e551223065f414988016a156d5909a57846","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,252,126,85,18,35,6,95,65,73,136,1,106,21,109,89,9,165,120,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
