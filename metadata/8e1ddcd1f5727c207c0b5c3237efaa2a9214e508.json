In order to endure the stress of being confined to their high-tech vessel, the crew passes the time using advanced virtual reality modules that allow them to take on various identities. But as the ship approaches a critical phase of their journey, a deadly flaw is discovered in the virtual system, forcing them to question if someone onboard might be a killer.\n\nIMDb RATING: 7.0/10 (1,312 votes)\n\nRuntime........: 87 mins\nVideo Bitrate..: 950 kbps\nAspect Ratio...: 1.81:1\nResolution.....: 640 x 352\nFrame Rate.....: 23.976 fps\nAudio Bitrate..: 160 kbps MP3 VBR Stereo English\n\ncredit VoMiT &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE even the CRITICIZERS :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e1ddcd1f5727c207c0b5c3237efaa2a9214e508","amp;dn":"Virtuality.2009.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e1ddcd1f5727c207c0b5c3237efaa2a9214e508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,29,220,209,245,114,124,32,124,11,92,50,55,239,170,42,146,20,229,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
