Martin's brilliant, juxtaposed wordplay, sly commentary, and hilarious observations are delivered with such a droll wit that only a dead person will avoid unabashed laughter. Genius is in the ear of the beholder and Martin's metronomic timing allows each sentence to unravel perfectly. His deadpan delivery is often clever enough to make you laugh twice at the same line and makes it clear why he has enjoyed such remarkable success as an actor, screenwriter, playwright, and author.\n\nDetails\nAudio CD\nAuthor: Steve Martin\nRead By: Steve Martin\nPublisher: Simon &amp; Schuster Audio; Unabridged edition\nReleased: November 20, 2007\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0743571533\nISBN-13: 978-0743571531\nFile Type: rar\nFile Size: 77.1 MB\nFormat: mp3\nBit Rate: 96 kbps\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHuge selection of audiobooks available at the blog.\n\nIf you visit, please take the time to click on a few ads.
