The diversity of subjects appeals to all levels of experience and spans such topics as amateur robotics, circuit design, lasers, computer control, home automation, data acquisition, new technology, DIY projects, electronic theory, analog, and myriad microcontrollers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96e9747a48ed06090845a22f92799be4c1fdea9","amp;dn":"Nuts+%26+Volts+-+July+2010+%28True+PDF%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96e9747a48ed06090845a22f92799be4c1fdea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,110,151,71,164,142,208,96,144,132,90,34,249,39,153,190,76,31,222,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
