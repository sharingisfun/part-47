This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nSUBTITLES: external, English for hearing impaired.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:931b779d496ed5db357c93af5a2d57f1b42c08e0","amp;dn":"How.I.Met.Your.Mother.S05E15.360p.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"931b779d496ed5db357c93af5a2d57f1b42c08e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,27,119,157,73,110,213,219,53,124,147,175,90,45,87,241,180,44,8,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
