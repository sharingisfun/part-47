They've named it &quot;Orang       \n         Pendek&quot; - the little man of the forest. A recent scientific   \n         discovery proposes that another species of humans -           \n         nicknamed 'hobbits' - did once live in Indonesia. So could    \n         there be a new great ape waiting to be discovered? Or is      \n         it possible we're not the only human species living on        \n          earth?
