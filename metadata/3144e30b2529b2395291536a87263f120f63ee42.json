Griffith set in late 18th century France, before and during the French Revolution.\n\nThis was the last Griffith film to feature Lillian and Dorothy Gish, and is often considered Griffith's last major commercial success, after boxoffice hits such as Birth of a Nation, Intolerance, and Broken Blossoms.\n\nLike his earlier films, this used historical events to comment on contemporary events, in this case the French Revolution and the rise of Bolshevism. The film is about class conflict and a plea for inter class understanding and against destructive hatred. At one point in front of the Committee of Public Safety a main character pleas, &quot;Yes I am an aristocrat, but a friend of the people.&quot;\n\nThe film is a remake of the lost Theda Bara film The Two Orphans (1915).\n\nThe torrent include some posters, stills of the film and a Spanish external subtitle.\n\nIMDB: 8.3/10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0012532/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0012532/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n*****************************FREAKYFLICKS*****************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and\nsharing cinematic art in the digital era.
