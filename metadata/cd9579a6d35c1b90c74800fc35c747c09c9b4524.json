Anyway, his director's cut of Aliens, which he put together in 1991, runs 154 minutes and is the true version of the movie. The original theatrical version, which runs 137 minutes, felt incomplete when it first appeared and is fairly useless now. The additional material doesn't just enrich the story, it elegantly ties the plot together and draws you through its adventure and excitement with a solid narrative logic.\n\nThe picture transfer is identical to the older DVD, but it is also the most problematic. Not only is it very grainy much of the time, but the grain and the ambitious running times create noticeable digital artifacting flaws, especially during darker sequences. Otherwise, colors and fleshtones appear reasonably fresh. The 5.1-channel Dolby Digital sound is also identical to the earlier mix. It has a little more surround activity than Alien does, but it is still rather subdued in comparison to the later films.\n\nCameron is featured extensively on the commentary track, along with producer Gale Anne Hurd, four effects supervisors and a half dozen cast members. They reminisce about the movie, explain how things were staged, share a few anecdotes and that sort of thing. Cameron also tackles the film's graininess head on. &quot;In this exact year, I think Kodak was in transition, they were changing their emulsions. This was a higher speed negative than had been used previously. They hadn't worked out their 't-grain' emulsion, so it turned out to be grainier than I would have wanted, but this was actually the standard, this is just what that stock was, that year, and because we weren't using the full negative like you would with an anamorphic film, we weren't getting quite as much image quality. I was surprised recently when I screened this film at how grainy it was. Of course, nobody noticed the grain at the time.&quot; Nobody except LD fans, who were up in arms when the film first came out in a blur that has now been substantially rectified.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd9579a6d35c1b90c74800fc35c747c09c9b4524","amp;dn":"Alien+Quadrilogy+Disc+3+Untouched+NTSC+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd9579a6d35c1b90c74800fc35c747c09c9b4524","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,149,121,166,211,92,27,144,199,72,0,252,53,199,71,192,156,155,69,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
