It reached number 2 on the U.S. Hot 100. It later became an MTV classic, and is generally regarded as the band's signature song.\n\nAlthough the band was nearing the end of recording sessions for Hysteria in 1986, producer Mutt Lange felt that the album was still lacking a song that would have an appeal beyond the hard rock fans who had bought Pyromania. That song came to him during a 5 minute coffee break.\n\nSinger Joe Elliott was jamming with a riff he'd come up with recently on the guitar, and Lange suggested that the riff be taken a step further. It was a risky move, as everyone in the band had been worn out by the never-ending sessions.\n\nWithin two weeks the song was completed, smoothed out and included as the 12th track on Hysteria. &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot; was released as the second single from the album in the UK, where it reached the top 20. \n\nIn 2005, the single was awarded RIAA Gold certification for digital downloads of over 500,000 units, despite the fact that it was not commercially released that year. It is one of very few songs recorded before 2004 to accomplish this feat.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e523f589802d2d6367296311c671d8f5c960dc1d","amp;dn":"Def+Leppard+-+Pour+Some+Sugar+On+Me+%28live+at+BIG+in+2005+awards%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e523f589802d2d6367296311c671d8f5c960dc1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,35,245,137,128,45,45,99,103,41,99,17,198,113,216,245,201,96,220,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
