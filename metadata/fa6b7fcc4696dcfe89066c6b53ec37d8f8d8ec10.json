But salacious gatherings to honour the Goddess, Paculla Annia, historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most wanton female, are happening right on MimiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doorstep.\n\nThe spirit lives on in the form of Morgana, a luscious priestess who runs a coven of sex-hungry devotees, all schooled in the Dark Arts and moulded in the image of those mythical hunter-savages, the bacchantes. Morgana is assisted by Haydn Shady, a depraved man with an evil disposition and a desire for immortality. Mimi doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know it but both Morgana and Shady are coming for her to settle their power struggle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the witch to take her as a lover, the villain to sacrifice her to the hunter girls.\n\nGenre: Erotic Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa6b7fcc4696dcfe89066c6b53ec37d8f8d8ec10","amp;dn":"Witch+Hunter+-+Sears%2C+Willow.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa6b7fcc4696dcfe89066c6b53ec37d8f8d8ec10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,107,127,204,70,150,220,254,137,6,108,107,83,236,55,216,248,216,236,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
