(or UFOÃƒÂ¢??s) that were developed in World War 2 by the Nazis. \n\nIn regards to this video please note the following:\n\n1. This video is certainly NOT a Hollywood production, (it is the information that is important here, not the graphics or the special effects) and:\n\n2. Yes the music used can be pretty ÃƒÂ¢??tragicÃƒÂ¢??, it was 1991, and if it annoys you please try to ignore it.\n\n3. As it has been converted from an old video, although I have tried to have the highest quality that I can, can be a bit rough in places.\n\nWith oil and energy prices rising all the time, what a crime it is that this (plus many other ÃƒÂ¢??free energyÃƒÂ¢?? technologies), are still being suppressed from the general public as PROFITS are all that seem to matter. \n\nFor more information on the subject, this site is very comprehensive:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.eyepod.org/Nazi-Disc-Photos.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.eyepod.org/Nazi-Disc-Photos.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSome information about this video for you:\n\nVideo type: avi \nCodec: Xvid\nAudio: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (170kb/s)\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nFYI: Some further documentaries on this subject include:\n\nFor what happened after World War 2 with the Nazi disks and their developers, the following superb documentary by Chris Everard, called ÃƒÂ¢??Secret SpaceÃƒÂ¢??:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3848080/Secret_Space_Vol._1_The_Illuminati_s_Conquest_of_Space&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3848080/Secret_Space_Vol._1_The_Illuminati_s_Conquest_of_Space&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlthough in my opinion, this documentary is a bit disappointing, (and contains a bit of disinformation in parts), it does have a good segment and some more evidence of where the disks were developed and tested:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3602911/UFO_s_Secret_Evidence_(DivX)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3602911/UFO_s_Secret_Evidence_(DivX)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd finally, if you haven&amp;#039;t seen it this documentary, it also covers what happened during and after WW2:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3717306/The_Secret_Underground_Lectures_Of_Commander_X_[AVI_-_Conspiracy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3717306/The_Secret_Underground_Lectures_Of_Commander_X_[AVI_-_Conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d10e112e216252a8ff82e5588716003e52615b6","amp;dn":"UFO+Secrets+of+WW11+German+Flying+Saucers+%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d10e112e216252a8ff82e5588716003e52615b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,16,225,18,226,22,37,42,143,248,46,85,136,113,96,3,229,38,21,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
