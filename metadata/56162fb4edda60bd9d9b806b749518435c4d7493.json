Dr. Phil examines why young girls are becoming cruel, mean, and bossy, and he has help from the co-stars of Mean Girls 2, Maiara Walsh and Meaghan Martin. First up, Sheila says her daughter, Kayla, threatens other kids at school, steals their lunch and punches them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only 9! But little Kayla says her 11-year-old sister, Haley, is the real bully. Find out why, and learn whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s behind the sistersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ mean girl attitudes. Plus, were Maiara and Meaghan ever bullied as kids? The stars reveal painful playground memories and share tips to help young ladies empower themselves. And, Dr. Phil explains what parents can do when their daughter feels excluded by the popular girls at school.
