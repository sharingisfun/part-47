On that day, a Colombian military intelligence force, using a strategy of deceit, rescued 15 hostages from the jungles of Colombia. The hostages where being held by dozens of armed guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC. Throughout the rescue operation, not a single shot was fired, no one was killed and no one was harmed. Through never before seen footage of the planning and execution of the operation, a video taken by the duped guerillas, firsthand accounts of the rescued hostages and for the first time, the testimonies of the intelligence commandoes who executed the mission, this documentary presents the dramatic, real story of one of the most successful rescue operations in history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47ae90a8d305bd32e319638f33ef5a2b4368144c","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Colombia.Hostage.Rescue.HDTV.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47ae90a8d305bd32e319638f33ef5a2b4368144c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,174,144,168,211,5,189,50,227,25,99,143,51,239,90,43,67,104,20,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
