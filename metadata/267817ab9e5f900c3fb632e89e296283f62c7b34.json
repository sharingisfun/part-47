Produced by John Shanks, the album was released November 10, 2009, with the new single &quot;We Weren't Born to Follow&quot; premiering on radio August 17. The album was released in Germany on October 30, 2009.\n\nIn an interview given to Rolling Stone Magazine, guitarist Richie Sambora says the album is a return to &quot;rock and roll&quot; and said &quot;ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to be some big choruses on there. It sounds like Bon Jovi, but it sounds fresh. We experimented with a lot of new sounds and had a really good time working with John Shanks, who is also a really good guitar player, so he and I did a lot of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“weaselingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ with the guitar sounds. There are a lot of really good guitar sounds and new kind atmospheres on the new Bon Jovi record, that I think makes it really modern. I think people are going to dig it, man. And it rocks hard.&quot;\n\nThe Circle Tour will ensue the following year, &quot;2010, probably spring time weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll get going. And weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to go for a long time. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to be a big one.&quot; Sambora stated.\n\nIn an interview on UK radio station Absolute Radio, Jon Bon Jovi stated the album title has multiple meanings. It stands for the fact that a circle is never ending, and that it also refers to Bon Jovi's inner circle - stating that &quot;in this organization, the circle is very difficult to get into, and even more difficult to get out of.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:267817ab9e5f900c3fb632e89e296283f62c7b34","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+We+Weren%5C%27t+Born+To+Follow++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"267817ab9e5f900c3fb632e89e296283f62c7b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,120,23,171,158,95,144,12,63,182,50,232,158,41,98,131,246,44,123,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
