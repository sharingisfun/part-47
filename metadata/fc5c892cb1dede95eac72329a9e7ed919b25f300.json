Detective Del Spooner is called out to investigate the apparent suicide of the scientist behind these robots, Dr. Alfred Lanning. Spooner suspects that the death might not be a suicide, but the result of one of the robots. All robots are programmed by three laws, but Spooner starts to wonder if a robot can in fact feel emotions, and possibly murder. But if Spooner's suspicions are true, he is going to have a hard time convincing everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc5c892cb1dede95eac72329a9e7ed919b25f300","amp;dn":"I%2C+Robot+%282004%29+Special+Edition+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc5c892cb1dede95eac72329a9e7ed919b25f300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,92,137,44,177,222,222,149,234,199,35,41,169,231,237,145,155,37,243,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
