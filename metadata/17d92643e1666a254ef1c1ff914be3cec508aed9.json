This remux has the original audio from the film (narrated by Jared) and the new audio version (narrated by Alex himself).\n\nThe first track contains the original audio taken from an old copy I have of this film. Unfortunately, the copy only had MP3 audio so no multi-channel. The audio is perfectly synced with the video\n\nThe second track is just copied from the torrent of iFPD. It is multi-chan AC-3 @ 448kbps and this version is narrated by Alex himself instead of Jared.\n\nWhy offer this torrent with the original audio? \n\nWell, I grew up with the original film on VHS which is narrated by Jared. Also I find that the narration by Jared gives this film an unique touch and I find the narration by Alex a bit weird since I'm so used to the voice of Jared narrating the film\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17d92643e1666a254ef1c1ff914be3cec508aed9","amp;dn":"Nemesis.1992.1080p.BluRay.OriginalAudio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17d92643e1666a254ef1c1ff914be3cec508aed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,217,38,67,225,102,106,37,78,241,193,255,145,75,227,206,197,8,174,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
