After the blasts, it was all over. Nuclear Winter has settled upon the earth. Except for one hour of sunlight a day, the whole world is plunged into darkness. It is a near-perfect environment for vampires. They have won. It is their time. Almost every single man, woman and child has been enslaved in vast camps across the globe. Like animals, they are farmed, harvested for the sick pleasure of the Master Race.\n\nAlmost, but not all. Somewhere out there, hiding for their lives, is a desperate network of free humans, continue the seemingly hopeless resistance. Everyday people, with no other options - among them Dr Ephraim Goodweather, his son Zack, the veteran exterminator Vassily, and former gangbanger Gus.\n\nTo be free, they need a miracle, they need divine intervention. But Salvation can be a twisted game - one in which they may be played like pawns in a battle of Good and Evil. And at what cost?\n\nUnabridged.\nRead by Daniel Oreskes.\n\n-----------------------------\nVisit us for loads more:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10086413ee5163733a24062c6f279e0f9e482029","amp;dn":"The+Night+Eternal+by+Guillermo+Del+Toro+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10086413ee5163733a24062c6f279e0f9e482029","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,8,100,19,238,81,99,115,58,36,6,44,111,39,158,15,158,72,32,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
