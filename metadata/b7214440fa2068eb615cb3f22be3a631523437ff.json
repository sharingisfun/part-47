This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nTwo of the extras in this countdown were part of the original show (meaning that Premier Radio didn't leave anything out of this one). The third, which was from some other broadcast (but still introduced by Casey), is a song by a woman who convinced Buddha Records to include her recipes for health salads on the back of her album covers.\n\nThere is a debut song (&quot;River Deep-Mountain High&quot; at number 35) which teams up The Supremes &amp; The Four Tops.\n\nThere is a song that takes its title from a line of dialog from a 1926 silent movie starring Mary Pickford.\n\nAnd the year-end countdown (the very first one!) that you keep hearing Casey speak of has already been torrented in all it's beautiful completeness.
