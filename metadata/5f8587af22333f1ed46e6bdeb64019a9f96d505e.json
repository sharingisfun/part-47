This is a RIP of an original CD.\n\nIt contains maps that had won Bungie's various map making contests, I've personally played a few and they all are quite fun.\n\nSince Marathon is now completely free to play, I feel it's fine to upload the best community made maps that have been long missed from the game.\n\n/// COMPATIBILITY &amp; WHERE TO FIND PLAYERS ///\n\nIf you're playing on a PowerPC Macintosh without classic installed, you'll need the Aleph One player.\n\nIf you're running on an Intel Macintosh, PowerPC Macintosh, or Windows PC you will need the Aleph One player.\n\nYou can find the Aleph One players here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/marathon/\n\nSimply place the Aleph One player in the same folder as the game and play using the Aleph One player.\n\n/// LOADING THE MAPS OFF THE CD ///\n\nOn a PC you can use software such as Alcohol 120% to mount the ISO and download the maps, or you can burn it to a CD if you wish.\n\nOn a Macintosh you can use Disk Utility or simply double-click the ISO to mount it and download the maps, or you can burn it to a CD with Disk Utility.\n\n/// SOMETHING WRONG? ///\n\nIf there's anything wrong with the disc, please tell me in the comments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f8587af22333f1ed46e6bdeb64019a9f96d505e","amp;dn":"Original+Marathon+Map+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f8587af22333f1ed46e6bdeb64019a9f96d505e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,133,135,175,34,51,63,30,212,110,107,222,182,64,25,169,249,109,80,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
