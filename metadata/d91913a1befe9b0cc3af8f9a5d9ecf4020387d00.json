Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful &amp; advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems &amp; is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers &amp; leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X - or will a darker future await man following the nuclear attack?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d91913a1befe9b0cc3af8f9a5d9ecf4020387d00","amp;dn":"Terminator+3+-+Rise+of+the+Machines+Blu-ray+1080p+DD5.1-CtrlHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d91913a1befe9b0cc3af8f9a5d9ecf4020387d00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,25,19,161,190,254,155,12,195,175,143,154,93,158,207,64,32,56,125,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
