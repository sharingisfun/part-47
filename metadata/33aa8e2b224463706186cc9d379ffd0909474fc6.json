Once a NASCAR champion, Jensen Ames, (Jason Statham), hits rock bottom and spent several years in prison. His life was improving and changing for the better after meeting and marrying Suzy (Janaya Stephens) and having a baby girl. Then the steel mill closes, and he loses his job. But that was not the worst thing to happen to Jenson that day. Suzy is brutally murdered, and he is framed for her murder. Jenson is sent to Terminal Island, the worst and toughest for-profit prison in the country run by Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen). She has created the country's most popular pay-per-view sport, a kill-or-be-killed car race where the inmates race to win their freedom from prison after 5 wins. Every inmate driver is driving a monster car that they built which is loaded with machine guns, missiles, flamethrowers, napalm, and no rules. Warden Hennessey convinces Jensen to secretly take the place of the late 4-time superstar winner, Frankenstein, and wear his metallic mask in the race. If Jensen wins just one race, he can go home to his baby daughter. To get to the finish line, Jensen must kill his competition before they kill him.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452608/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452608/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIf you are looking for the aXXo rip its here... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4560022/Death.Race[2008][Unrated.Edition]DvDrip-aXXo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4560022/Death.Race[2008][Unrated.Edition]DvDrip-aXXo&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe 2CD HQ rip is here.... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4557463/Death.Race.UNRATED.DVDRip.XviD-DASH_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4557463/Death.Race.UNRATED.DVDRip.XviD-DASH_&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe trackers seem stuck, but there are like 200 seeds and 400 leechers...\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33aa8e2b224463706186cc9d379ffd0909474fc6","amp;dn":"Death+Race%5B2008%5DDvDrip-DinarMovies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33aa8e2b224463706186cc9d379ffd0909474fc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,170,142,43,34,68,99,112,97,134,204,157,55,159,253,9,9,71,79,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
