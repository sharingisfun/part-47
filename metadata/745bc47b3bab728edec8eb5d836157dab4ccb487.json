The distraught old matador finds comfort in the tender arms of an American fan. Unfortunately, her old boyfriend gets jealous and proclaims the fighter a coward. In time, the matador and his student enter the ring together for a final battle. It is here in the unforgiving arena that the true nature of their relationship is revealed. The film's director Budd Boetticher, gives the film added realism as he, a former matador, also worked as the technical advisor. Originally, the bull-fighting scenes were more graphic, but squeamish censors intervened and the scenes were heavily edited.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048331/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048331/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nBudd Boetticher\n\n\n\n        Maureen O'Hara\t ... \tKaren Harrison\n\n\tAnthony Quinn\t... \tLuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s Santos\n\tManuel Rojas\t... \tRafael Reyes\n\tRichard Denning\t... \tMark Russell\n\tThomas Gomez\t... \tDon David\n\n\n Video #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : VC-1\n      Format profile : MP@ML\n      Codec ID : WMV3\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Video 9\n      Codec ID/Hint : WMV3\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 1 000 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.130\n      Stream size : 646 MiB (90%)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : WMA2\n      Format profile : L\n      Codec ID : 161\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Audio 2\n      Description of the codec : Windows Media Audio 9.2 -  96 kbps, 44 kHz, stereo 2-pass VBR\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 95.9 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 62.0 MiB (9%)\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:745bc47b3bab728edec8eb5d836157dab4ccb487","amp;dn":"The+Magnificent+Matador+%281955%29+Anthony+Queen+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"745bc47b3bab728edec8eb5d836157dab4ccb487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,91,196,123,59,171,114,142,222,200,235,93,131,97,87,218,180,204,180,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
