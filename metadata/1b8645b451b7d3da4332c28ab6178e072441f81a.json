Do you know where you children are?&quot; In fact, there's a station in New York that still does it.\n\nThat question or maybe a somewhat-modified version is even more relevant today: &quot;Parents, it's 2010. Do you know what your children are learning?&quot;\n\nYou should. There is a concerted effort to indoctrinate your children with progressive propaganda, going on right now. It's everywhere: the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon, with the global warming agenda. And many of our nation's schools are hitting our kids with the full progressive assault.\n\nThursday, the &quot;The National Day of Action to Defend Education&quot; took place. It sounds innocent enough. The rally Web site says the event was to protest against the current assault on public education: tuition hikes, budget cuts, furlough days, intentional reduction in enrollment.\n\nSo if it's really just about education and protecting the kids, why did virtually every socialist and communist organization in existence support this event? Groups like Students for a Democratic Society, the Socialist Party USA, several progressive student alliances and something called Fight Imperialism ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Stand Together among many more. For a school function?\n\nA faction of La Raza ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a Latino civil rights organization ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is jumping onboard and they are apparently trying to turn this into an &quot;education is a right&quot; message and use this platform for allowing illegal aliens to use in-state tuition as their protest message. M.E.Ch.A is also involved ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they're a radical group who wants to reclaim the Southwestern U.S. for Mexico.\n\nWhat's going on? Well, there's a battle for the hearts and minds of your children. While you're busy trying to make a living and navigate through the daily madness piling up all around you, progressives are working on indoctrinating America's youth, your kids. Everything is about planet worship, social justice and supporting Barack Obama. Just look what's happening in our schools:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Yes, we can, can, can!\nYes, we can, can, can!\nYes, we, can, can, can!\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nProgressives and Obama are getting considerable help from teachers in our public schools:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMmm, mmm, mmm!\nBarack Hussein Obama\n\nHe said that all must lend a hand\nTo make this country strong again\n\nMmm, mmm, mmm!\nBarack Hussein Obama\n\nHe said we must be fair today\nEqual work means equal pay\n\nMmm, mmm, mmm!\nBarack Hussein Obama\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nIt's not enough to simply indoctrinate them with the progressive agenda, they're also being told that they know more than you, their parents. We've shown you that progressives like Al Gore have pitted children against their parents. This is Gore telling thousands of teens and preteens at an inaugural youth conference in Washington last year not to listen to their parents:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nFORMER VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE: There are some things about our world that you know, that older people don't know.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nI'm sure those parents appreciated Al telling their impressionable kids that they know more about life than they do. Maybe they appreciate Meghan McCain saying this:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMEGHAN MCCAIN: I consider myself a progressive Republican.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMaybe Meghan attended some of those child-empowerment camps. She seems to think that her wisdom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ at 24 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ exceeds the knowledge and wisdom of the feeble old coots, who like... at like... 40 or 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦are so, likeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ stupid:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMCCAIN: And I have taken heat, but in fairness to me, I am a different generation than the people that are giving me heat. I'm 24 years old. I'm not in my 40s, I'm not in my 50s and older.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAnd Obama's own Web site, during the campaign, featured a video called &quot;The Talk,&quot; in which kids had &quot;the talk&quot; about Obama and political issues with their parents:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED GIRL: It almost feels like a parent-child conversation, except I'm the parent and they're the child.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nEncouraging kids ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ some on that video couldn't have been any more than 14 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to presume that they have more knowledge, wisdom, experience and political savvy than their parents do is absolutely despicable. I mean, think back to what you thought you knew at 14 or even 24 and what you now know. Even if you had an IQ of 500 when you were a teen, the maturity, reason and logic that comes with age and experiencing life just isn't there.\n\nAnd Obama knows that. If he can convince them, before they have the chance to develop their senses, he has a chance to &quot;change&quot; the mindset of this nation. And that's exactly what he and his allies are trying to do.\n\nAn Obama supporter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ let's call him Eric ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ has written a book ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ let's call it &quot;Eric's Book.&quot; Now, keep in mind, it's a book that sold about eight copies, but the point is this is part of an overall agenda. The book and video are propaganda pieces that would make Joseph Goebbels proud. The video is dedicated to twisting the youth of America into progressive zombies:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A new generation.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A new generation...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED GIRL: Is coming to power.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nThis is his &quot;Generation We,&quot; born between 1978 and 2000. He is aggressively trying to mold those 95 million young people into a massive, collective, progressive voting block that would fundamentally transform, America:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are more globally oriented.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're more ethnically diverse.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're more technologically adept.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Better educated.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Less politically partisan.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED BOY: And we're the first generation in American history...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED GIRL: To inherit a nation...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: In decline.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWow. More globally oriented? Right, stop with your patriotic nonsense, we're building global citizens ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ there's no need for U.S. sovereignty. That's for like... old people who are maybe, like... forty? Remember this guy's a clown and is having minimal impact. But it's a pattern. This message is found throughout the progressive movement ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that your children are &quot;better educated,&quot; they're smarter than you. You can't begin to understand the things they do. You're not capable.\n\nI was also moved by the &quot;less politically partisan&quot; line there, when absolutely every line in this abomination is partisan, leftist, progressive propaganda. But, let's find out why they're the only generation to inherit a nation in decline:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED GIRL: Some of us are losing our homes.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our dependence on fossil fuels...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED BOY: Has polluted our environment.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our water is contaminated...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED BOY: And our health is in danger.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nFirst of all, I hate to see anyone &quot;lose their home,&quot; but could there be a reason for it? Maybe your uneducated, dad just isn't smart enough to hold down a job? I mean, he's probably older than twenty-five.\n\nThen, there's the environmental hogwash. I don't know about you, but I can't get enough of this discredited hoax. &quot;Our water is contaminated&quot;? Really?\n\nIt's a shame that &quot;Generation We&quot; is too young to remember Lake Erie on fire. Now that's contamination ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ water so polluted, it bursts into flame. And, before you start sending out your Tweets, I know, it was technically the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland that spontaneously combusted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ so sue me.\n\nThe point is our lakes, rivers, streams and virtually all waterways are much cleaner now than they were 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Our standards are higher, as is awareness, so companies can't just dump waste into water supplies anymore... unless you're doing business in China. We do nearly everything cleaner now than ever.\n\nAs a parent, it's really shocking the way this uses our children, some of these kids are 10 years old. But it's important to know about this attempt at brainwashing your children.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b8645b451b7d3da4332c28ab6178e072441f81a","amp;dn":"Glenn+Beck+TV+-+March+5th+2010+-+Indoctrination+Of+Our+Kids","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b8645b451b7d3da4332c28ab6178e072441f81a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,134,69,180,81,183,211,218,67,50,194,138,182,23,142,7,36,65,248,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
