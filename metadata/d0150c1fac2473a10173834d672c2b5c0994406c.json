You can use the Fedora operating system to replace or to run alongside of other operating systems such as Microsoft WindowsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ or Mac OS XÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢. The Fedora operating system is 100% free of cost for you to enjoy and share.\n\n\nWhat will I need?\n\n    * A blank CD or DVD or a blank 1GB+ USB stick.\n    * A 400 MHz or faster processor\n    * At least 512 MB memory (RAM), 1 GB recommended for best performance\n    * At least 10 GB hard drive space (only required for installation)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHope you guys enjoy this and don't forget to seed. I will upload another torrent once this has enough seeds.\n\nREMINDER - This is the 64-Bit version of Fedora 14. If you are running on a 32-Bit system then you will need the 32-Bit version which I will be uploading soon.\n\n\nPeace,\nAngelus\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0150c1fac2473a10173834d672c2b5c0994406c","amp;dn":"Fedora+14+64-Bit+%7BAngelus1609%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0150c1fac2473a10173834d672c2b5c0994406c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,21,12,31,172,36,115,161,1,115,131,77,103,44,43,92,9,148,64,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
