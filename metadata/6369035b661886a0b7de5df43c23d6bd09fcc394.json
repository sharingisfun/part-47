He combines breakdancing and hip-hop with mime using movements that are simultaneously precise and fluid.\n\nA self-taught dancer combining freestyle hip-hop with mime and contemporary dance, Kenichi Ebina incorporates visual illusion into his performances, making the impossible seem real. His agile, athletic and razor-sharp moves push the limits of human capability. Each of his performances is a mini-drama that draws from kinetic and thematic inspiration to tell a story that is laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nEbina is the founder of BiTriP (Bi-Triangle Performance), a hip-hop dance troupe that won the famous Amateur Night at the Apollo; later, as a solo performer, Kenichi again carried off the Apollo crown. He's a dancer, choreographer, teacher and performer, working with collaborators or on his own as Ebina Performing Arts.\n\nHe has performed everywhere from his home in New York to San Francisco to Bangkok. He's preparing now for his first full-evening solo show, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, in early 2008.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?
