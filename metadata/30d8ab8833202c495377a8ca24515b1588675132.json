And in fact nothing of British has brilliance to any extent that\nit lacks validity of native Germanic intelligence at source, I submit.\n\nThis movie does have a happy ending, however there is an unforgivable moment\nfor the planet that makes such movies, and for the actors who allow for such\nscenes as to see a woman of this human supreme beauty physically assaulted\nby a man who isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t taken down for it by those present and in attendance.\nOh well, we have to make for a better world where no one is second guessed\nso easily as I have no hesitation in doing in respect of what are my own\ninstincts of showing care and protectiveness towards kin, and our womenfolk\nmost of all.\n\n\nThere are some parallels to the movie Absurdistan in showing the grave\nincompatibilities between eastern cultured mindsets (such as Turkey\nin this example) and those of the best of Western mankind - Germanic beauty\nintelligence and wit.\n\n\nThe Turkish man in the movie describes his relationship to his German\nFrau as &quot;bought&quot; and he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t hesitate to treat her this way. How very\ncruel indeed that anyone should find themselves in such circumstances\nwhen nothing should prevent merited people from surviving and choosing\nto thrive in sanity instead.\n\nThe EU has some difficult decisions head, and it is most of all my hope and\nprayer that Germany will survive with its spirit intact - free of any influences that would tear it apart at the core.\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmoviesbyrizzo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30d8ab8833202c495377a8ca24515b1588675132","amp;dn":"Jerichow+%282008%29+DivX+224k+audio+%28moviesbyrizzo%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30d8ab8833202c495377a8ca24515b1588675132","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,216,171,136,51,32,44,73,83,119,168,202,36,81,91,21,136,103,81,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
