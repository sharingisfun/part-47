He has copied all the text from the english versions to the japenese version which has already been patched for anti piracy.\n\nThese are the Japanese version of Pokemon Heart Gold/Soul Silver with all English text copied from the english rom. It is the best way around the anti piracy on the english roms so far. There are a few things still in japanese such as the pokedex and uneeded conversations. This rom works perfect on just about all flashcards eg R4 although with no$gba there has been some reports of freezing when saving. There has also been some reports of the ysmenu freezing although it seems to work for me perfectly. Enjoy  :) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:515085c4eb755074edc16864f6c188bfb52e81d8","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Heart+Gold%2FSoul+Silver+Anti+Piracy+Work+Around","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"515085c4eb755074edc16864f6c188bfb52e81d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,80,133,196,235,117,80,116,237,193,104,100,246,193,136,191,181,46,129,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
