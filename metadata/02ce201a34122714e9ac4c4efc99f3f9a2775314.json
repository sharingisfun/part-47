They also issued an annual (what other kind is there?) calendar from (at least) the years 1972 through 1979 (as far as I can tell).  I remember my brother having one of these calendars when I was about 10 years old and thought it was the most hilarious thing ever.  I am still looking for a copy of the one that he used to have, I think it was 1975. Anyway, for those interested in a look back at the 70s (and who isn't), here is a tiny glimpse of what was going on.  At least in Montana.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02ce201a34122714e9ac4c4efc99f3f9a2775314","amp;dn":"Wretched+Mess+Calendar+1974.cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02ce201a34122714e9ac4c4efc99f3f9a2775314","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,206,32,26,52,18,39,20,233,172,76,78,252,153,243,249,162,119,83,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
