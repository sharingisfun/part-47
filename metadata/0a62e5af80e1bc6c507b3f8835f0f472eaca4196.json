You will have to delete the &quot;ssWPI_App_DB.ini&quot; from the folders you update or it will not show the new apps in ssWPI, you can right click the list in ssWPI and pick Re-Scan for items to create new DB files (if using it from USB or an extracted folder prior to adding it back to an ISO).\n\nThis is self activating with KMSpico 9.3 and fully automated until the end of the install where you must reboot manually to enable UAC again.\n\nYou can switch the default account &quot;User&quot; (Home User) to your Outlook/Hotmail account without losing any of the tweaks/app installs. I've included a &quot;Change To Online Account.jpg&quot; to the root of the ISO that shows how to do this.\n\nI set auto update to notify you but not download automatically, this is easily changed from the settings.\n\nIncluded in ssWPI is Classic Shell for if you really hate the Metro/Modern Interface.\n\nThe default password for &quot;User&quot; is &quot;password&quot;, this was required as an empty password is not allowed at the log on stage of setup.\n\nThis is the first Windows 8+ mod I have done, so I don't expect it to be perfect and as I've only spent a short time on it (I don't get a lot of time to spare lately) it's not as complete as it could be.\n\nThe templat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a62e5af80e1bc6c507b3f8835f0f472eaca4196","amp;dn":"CosmOS+v8.1.1+ReturnOfNight+%28Nov+2013+Win+8.1+Mod%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a62e5af80e1bc6c507b3f8835f0f472eaca4196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,98,229,175,128,225,188,108,80,123,63,136,53,240,244,114,234,202,65,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
