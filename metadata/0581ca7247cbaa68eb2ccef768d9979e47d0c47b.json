(No character sprite atm though)\n\nFixed a few weapons that have issues.\n\nAdded frying pan as weapon properly. (no special sound yet can't seem to find a free one)\n\nFixed bug that meant some weapons never have a 'hit' frame and thus never hit zombies.\n\nPlanks stack once more.\n\nAdd 1366x768, 1920x1200 and 2560x1440 resolutions\nFixed issue with clip reloading. Remember HOLD R to load bullets, let go to put clip back in.\n\nFixed death anim.\n\nLowered initial zombie count. Still plenty though! Feedback welcome (It's hard since half want lots, half don't )\n\nFixed tree/door chopping.\n\nFixed hordes appearing indoors.
