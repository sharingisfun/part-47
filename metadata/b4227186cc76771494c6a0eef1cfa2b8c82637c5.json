Like I mentioned in one of my last uploads, I have been updating my workflow, and its almost done. From now on wards, uploads will be encoded using x265 and HE-AACv2 for superior audio quality.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is x265?\n\nIt is something which gives you upto 50% better compression when compared to x264 at the same bitrates.\nBut, there is still a lot of optimizing left to do for x265 devs. Many features which are available in x264 are not yet available in x265 not to mention the ridiculous ETA for each encode.\n\nA while ago when I tried x265 it had so many glitches that encoding it became pointless.\nCBR was the only available option at that time. But since then, a lot of improvements started showing up. Now CQ &amp; CRF are available, and it won't be long before 2 pass and other features of x264 start showing up.\n\nCurrently the downside to encoders is that it takes up a lot more time than x264 since x265 is much more CPU intensive.\n\nThat said, I am still sold on x265; the detail it can retain at nominal bit rates is great. After doing a few high resolution tests, I was convinced about the capabilities of x265.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nI have improved on my Audio workflow too, and now it will be better than my usual encodes. Improvements in Bass &amp; Surround Sound are included with audio encode with very high transparency. Audio will now be encoded using HE-AACv2.\n\nWhat is HE-AACv2?\n\nIt has a high compressibility and retains much more detail than AAC. It is an upgrade over many popular formats like MP3, AAC, AC3, etc.\n\n-------------------------------------------\nPlayback notes:\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTested with MPC(CCCP) v1.7.1 [32 &amp; 64 bit] (K-lite &amp; CCCP) and VLC 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.\n\nSystem config:\n1) i7 + GTX 540\n2) core2quad + ATI Radeon 5850\n\n-CCCP flawless playback, no issues with the 27th Nov release.\n-K-lite codec pack seems to be dropping frames but it can be re-configured.\n-64 bit version of MPC-HC needs to be configured correctly for flawless playback.\n-VLC may have issues with seeking; other than that, playback itself is flawless.\n\nSo all things considered I would recommend CCCP's configuration atm.\n\nCombined Community Codec Pack + Media Player - Classic Home Cinema Link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cccp-project.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cccp-project.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVLC media player link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\nFile Info:\n-------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral\nUnique ID : 190269784127125152024230923454527777878 (0x8F24A0A2489FB9B197D3B90122CF2C56)\nComplete name : Naruto Shippuuden - 341 [1080p] [x265.HE-AACv2] [jnx_r].mkv\nFormat : Matroska\nFormat version : Version 4 / Version 2\nFile size : 304 MiB\nDuration : 23mn 9s\nOverall bit rate : 1 833 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2013-12-13 02:32:24\nWriting application : mkvmerge v6.2.0 ('Promised Land Rovi v1.0.4') built on Aug 29 2013 13:59:38\nWriting library : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.0\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : HEVC\nFormat/Info : High Efficiency Video Coding\nCodec ID : V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC\nDuration : 23mn 9s\nWidth : 1 920 pixels\nHeight : 1 080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nTitle : x265 encoded by jnx_r\nDefault : Yes\nForced : Yes\n\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC [High Efficiency AAC v2]\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : A_AAC\nFile size : 26.7 MiB\nDuration : 23mn 9s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 159 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 212 Kbps\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\nOverall bit rate : 161 Kbps\nChannel count : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 26.4 MiB (99%)\nDelay relative to video : 9ms\nTitle : HE-AAC v2 encoded by jnx_r\nLanguage : Japanese\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\nWriting library : Nero AAC codec 1.5.4.0\nEncoding settings : -br 160000\nEncoded date : UTC 2013-12-13 00:01:08\n\n\nText\nID : 3\nFormat : ASS\nCodec ID : S_TEXT/ASS\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Sub Station Alpha\nCompression mode : Lossless\nTitle : English Subs CR\nLanguage : English\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\n\nMenu\n00:00:00.000 : en:Opening\n00:01:30.000 : en:Part I\n00:12:36.000 : en:Part II\n00:21:05.000 : en:Ending\n00:22:35.000 : en:Preview\n\n\n----------------------------------------------\n~~Thank you for downloading!~~\n----------------------------------------------\n\nPS: Seed, rate, comment, and share!\n\nregards,\n-jnx_r","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4227186cc76771494c6a0eef1cfa2b8c82637c5","amp;dn":"Naruto+Shippuden+341+%5B1080p%5D+%5Bx265%5D+%5BHE-AACv2%5D+%5BEng-Sub%5D+%5Bjnx_r%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4227186cc76771494c6a0eef1cfa2b8c82637c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,34,113,134,204,118,119,20,148,198,160,238,241,207,162,184,200,38,55,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
