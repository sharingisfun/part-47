We have seeded hundreds of gigabytes of our music through Pirate Bay's trackers, which converts to terabytes of music distributed with the help of mesh participants coming from all around the globe. \n\nIn the recent trial proceedings Peter Sunde characterized The Pirate Bay as an 'equalizer' in distribution. This has been our experience as well. On The Pirate Bay all released music is on the same line. Big promotion budgets, manipulated radio playlists and artificial media hype mean nothing there, only the content itself matters. Every sharer has an equal possibility of making an interesting textual description of what is being shared, and for a little while every sharer gets a global front page exposure in the never-ending stream of new releases. That's a very free and democratic environment for content producers, and to some it may sound almost revolutionary in the equality it provides. But it is really no more revolutionary than a library where all books are on the same line, side by side in alphabetic order, whether from established writers printed by big publishers or from unknown writers printed by small publishers. In the world of culture this is a natural order of things, and The Pirate Bay has brought this free library-like environment to the digital domain. This is a task that should naturally belong to the existing tax-funded national and local libraries, but as things are for now, our elected politicians in control of those libraries have chosen rather to serve the vested interests of the international copyright lobby rather than the interests of the people, of the culture and of the artists.\n\nReleased under Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution license.
