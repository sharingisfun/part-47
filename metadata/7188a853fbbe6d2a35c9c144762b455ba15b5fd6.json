This is Larry Jordan&amp;#039;s Soundtrack Pro 2 Essential Training series. In the folder you can find the training movies only. No exercise files available at the moment. \nImportant: This is a tutorial for a Mac application. There&amp;#039;s no Windows version of it for the time being, nor, it seems, will it be in the future.\n\n\nINFO. (from Lynda.com)\n\nThe soundtrack can make or break a video project, and it&amp;#039;s easier than ever to get professional-quality results using the latest software. In Soundtrack Pro 2 Essential Training, Apple Certified Trainer Larry Jordan shows how Soundtrack Pro 2 can be used to set up, record, edit, mix, and output professional soundtracks for media projects. He teaches the best post-production techniques for Final Cut Pro 6 projects and audio files, and covers everything from setting up preferences and repairing poor audio, to working with filters and mixing.\n\nReleased on: 2/29/2008\n\nFurther information on each chapter at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://movielibrary.lynda.com/html/modPage.asp?ID=465&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://movielibrary.lynda.com/html/modPage.asp?ID=465&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7188a853fbbe6d2a35c9c144762b455ba15b5fd6","amp;dn":"%C3%82%C2%A0Soundtrack+Pro+2+Essential+Training+-+Lynda.com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7188a853fbbe6d2a35c9c144762b455ba15b5fd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,136,168,83,251,190,109,42,53,201,193,68,118,43,69,91,161,91,95,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
