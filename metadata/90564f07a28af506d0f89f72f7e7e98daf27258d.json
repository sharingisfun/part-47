It was released on PC, Mac and\nPlaystation Portable on 14 November 2008.\n\nSome of the new features and box art for the game were announced via a\nseries of videos on 3 September 2008, other new features have been released\nvia a series of podcasts and online blogs.\n\nSports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson stated that it was likely\nthat the game would make its debut on DVD: it&amp;#039;s looking likely that the game\nwill need a DVD drive this year. Nothing confirmed as yet, but we were very\nclose to using the full CD size last year, multiple CDs is not an option\nunfortunately, and I am 95% sure at this stage that we&amp;#039;ll be too big for a CD.\n\nThe main new feature to the game is the 3D match engine. This can now be\nwatched fullscreen, with a widescreen option available. Other features\ninclude being able to play as a female or male manager, improvements to\nthe interaction between the manager and his assistant manager, improved\nmid-match team talks and tactics, training players to have preferred moves\nand transfer rumours. The player rating will have a decimal point, eg. 6.8\nor 8.3 instead of 7 or 8. There will also be press conferences, where you can\nbuild up a rapport with the journalists, and the finance and transfer systems\nhave been completely reworked. The game is set to feature more players than\never before, with over 350,000 in the database at the time of the game&amp;#039;s\nannouncement. Many of the new features were tested using a Football Manager\nLive beta. The PC version has a skin similar to the one used in Football\nManager 2008.\n\nThe handheld version will include a 2D match engine for the first time,\nand the game will be shipped with two skins; a light and a dark alternative.\n\nThere were errors on the release of the game, Steam causing many people\naggrivation and pain. The effects on the franchise have been numerous, with\nSteam at the heart of the problem. Due to high traffic levels, many people\nwere unable to activate the game, which had to be so via a product code\nwhich was sent via the SI Games website, which was unavailable.\n\nCompounding the problems with activation &amp; installation, all lines of\ncommunication with technical support have been in meltdown on launch day.\nThe official website of Sports Interactive has been crippled with disgruntled\nusers desperate to find out how to play the game. The only printed customer\nservices telephone number has been permanently engaged or ringing out.\n\nAn official petition to boycott the Football Manager series has been created\nwith over 12,000 signatures gathered by 3:30pm (GMT) on launch day. The nature\nof the unrest has fell in line with similar issues with recently released\nCommand &amp; Conquer 3.  \n\n  * OS: Windows XP or Vista\n  * Processor: XP: 1.4GHz or Faster / Vista: 2.0GHz or Faster\n  * Supported Processors: Intel Pentium 4, Intel Core, AMD Athlon\n  * Memory: XP: 512MB RAM / Vista: 1.0GB RAM\n  * Hard Drive Space: 2GB\n  * DVD-Drive: 4x Speed\n  * Video Card: 128MB *Supported Chipsets (see below)\n  * Sound Card: DirectX 9.0c compatible\n  * Directx: Version 9.0c (included)\n  * LAN: TCP/IP compliant\n  * Input: Keyboard, Mouse\n\n*Supported Chipsets ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Nvidia FX 5900 Ultra or greater; ATI Radeon 9800 or\ngreater; Intel 82915G/82910GL or greater.\nEarlier cards may only display 2D Match Viewer Mode and are not supported.\nLaptop versions of these chipsets may work but are not supported.\n\nINFO &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager_2009&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager_2009&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/sim/footballmanager2009/index.html?tag=result;title;0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/sim/footballmanager2009/index.html?tag=result;title;0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1.Install\n2.Apply new Patch from CRACK folder\n3.Apply crack\n4.Play\n\nWHEN YOU INSTALL SELECT Via Uniloc METHOD NOT via Steam !!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90564f07a28af506d0f89f72f7e7e98daf27258d","amp;dn":"FOOTBALL_MANAGER_2009-TL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90564f07a28af506d0f89f72f7e7e98daf27258d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,86,79,7,162,138,245,6,208,248,159,114,247,231,233,141,175,39,37,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
