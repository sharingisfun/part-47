This Pack (#2) Contains the\nfollowing 10 games:\n\n3 en Raya, Flash Player 5.0 r30, Macromedia, Inc.\n(A version of Naughts and Crosses [Tic-Tac-Toe], but does not\nuse X&amp;#039;s and O&amp;#039;s)\n\n3D Net Blazer, Flash Player 5.0 r30, Macromedia, Inc.\n(Shoot some hoops, basketball style!)\n\nThe above two games were added to this collection by PfP (that&amp;#039;s\nme). This package was originally from\nand included only the eigth games that follow. I added the\nprevious two in order to meet my 10 game minimum for a PfP\nArcade Pack.\n\nAsteroid Field,\n(Try to hit as many asteroids as you can as you travel through\nthe asteroid field. Use your mouse to aim and the spacebar to\nfire. If you get hit 50 times the game will end. This is NOT a\nclone of the arcade game Asteroids.)\n\nCrazy Arcade,\n(I haven&amp;#039;t figure this one out yet, but perhaps a visit to\nwill provide the enlightenment!)\n\nPacMan,\n(Hopefully, no explanation is needed for this one! After all,\nthere was a pop song [Pac-Man Fever] named after this one!)\n\nPrince of Persia,\n(You have 8 minutes to navigate the dungeon to the Vizier&amp;#039;s throne\nroom and stop him from unleashing the Sands of Time!)\n\nSnake,\n(Eat as many apples as you can, but don&amp;#039;t hit the walls or your\nown tail!)\n\nSpace Invaders,\n(This is NOT Space Invaders in the sense of the classic arcade\nmachine - it is more like GALAGA, or perhaps GALAXIAN.)\n\nTank,\n(Evil scientist Karbafos with his war machines capture city\nAlhador. Legendary Zorro Tank has only 1 day to kill all evil\nmachines and release city citizens from terror.)\n\nTETRIS Arcade!,\n(Yet another incarnation of this timeless classic! It&amp;#039;s fun with\na jamming soundtrack!)\n\nNote that the eight games fromautomatically launch your default browser and visitupon exiting the game. It is quite annoying, but some of the games are fun enough that it is tolerable!\n\nAll of the games in this pack are Macromedia Flash based games\nin executable (.exe) format, and should function with any 32-bit\nversion of Microsoft Windows.\n\nInstall, enjoy and look for more PfP Arcade Packs and other\nreleases soon.\n\nPfP - October 19, 2007\n\nPfP Arcade Pack #2 - 3 en Raya, 3D Net Blazer, Asteroid Field, Crazy Arcade, PacMan, Prince of Persia, Snake, Space Invaders, Tank, TETRIS Arcade!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a60c94d7c3cdc4fb14b98cd44eddb6c7d716054d","amp;dn":"PfP+Arcade+Pack+%232+-+3+en+Raya%2C+3D+Net+Blazer%2C+Asteroid+Field%2C+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a60c94d7c3cdc4fb14b98cd44eddb6c7d716054d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,12,148,215,195,205,196,251,20,185,140,212,78,221,182,199,215,22,5,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
