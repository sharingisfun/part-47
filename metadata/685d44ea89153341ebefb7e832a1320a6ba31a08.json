The young man from Switzerland who believed that Brazil was the country of his dreams was established in an area of degraded land in the southern state the early 1980s. Since then began a systematic recovery of soil and vegetation. Today 30 years after his farm is considered one of the most fertile and biodiverse region. Ernst developed a method of planting and management that seeks to imitate the processes of natural succession of species occurring in forests. His goal, as well as natural environments is to increase the quantity and quality of life in all its forms. As a result we see what we call agroforestry, a system that combines agricultural crops and forest ecosystem bringing benefits pro and pro producer. After a few days on the farm we traveled to get to know farmers who, having contact with the work of Ernst have improved the quality of life for their families through Agroforestry. In the district of Henry ItiÃƒÂºba know that with the help of his wife and six children managed to restructure the forest site productively and make it their main source of income. Back on the road and the trail of knowledge that was disseminated, we come to Capernaum in the semi-arid region of Bahia. There we find the toolcarriers Jurandir and the interior, we have learned to live with drought through agroforestry. Once you know the work of these farmers that put theory into practice and overcome social barriers and climatic realize that instead of showing what is wrong is our willingness to go after what works, what generates and inserts the human resources in the processes of multiplication of life on the planet. Counter to conventional fashion, let's not talk about scarcity but about ideas and most of all actions that go for plenty.\n\n--------------\n\nDocumentÃƒÂ¡rio realizado por Felipe Pasini, Ilana Nina e Monica Soffiatti. &quot;Neste ChÃƒÂ£o Tudo DÃƒÂ¡ - semeando conhecimento e colhendo resultados&quot; ÃƒÂ© um registro informal realizado durante uma viagem pela Bahia sobre o trabalho e o pensamento do agricultor e pesquisador Ernst Gotsch.
