With its affinity with the past, a lust for the future and plenty of natural soul, Mitchell &amp; Dewbury have created a modern classic. Everyone will love it. Mainstream music lovers; fanatical clubbers; occasional dabblers; specialists, occultists and collectors of all waters. But why?\n\nIt&amp;#039;s an essential blend of 21st Century soul, cosmic funk and deep jazz. Percussive heaven united by a positive Spirit. Everyone will recognise some of the scenery, many will spot their musical home - but nobody could possibly recognise it all. It&amp;#039;s clean without being sharp, it&amp;#039;s funky but not dated, it&amp;#039;s an exploration but never an indulgence. Lyrically, it starts with a dream of the opening words of the Bible and ends with the story of passing out from the earth and onwards, past the stars. In between, it picks you up and drops you off but never lets you down.\n\nDiscover Mitchell &amp; Dewbury&amp;#039;s inspiration in making &amp;#039;Rapping With The Gods&amp;#039; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed6993337cc3b449bad830f479c98ee3950e70e3","amp;dn":"Mitchell+%26+Dewbury+-+Rapping+with+the+Gods.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed6993337cc3b449bad830f479c98ee3950e70e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,105,147,51,124,195,180,73,186,216,48,244,121,201,142,227,149,14,112,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
