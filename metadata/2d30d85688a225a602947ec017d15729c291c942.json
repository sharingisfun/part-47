But 30's arrived, and none of the sweet promises of youth was fulfilled. \n\nAlone, failed and frustrated, all four are forced to stop and look around to try to understand where it all went wrong, and find an emergency fix for their lives, before it's too late, and happiness escapes through their fingers forever. Secondary Effects is the bitter coming of age comedy that follows their steps in the search for lost dreams, lost hair and good sex, at least, if true love turns out to be a mirage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d30d85688a225a602947ec017d15729c291c942","amp;dn":"Side+Effects.Efectos+Secundarios.EnglishSubtitled.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d30d85688a225a602947ec017d15729c291c942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,48,216,86,136,162,37,166,2,148,126,192,23,209,87,41,194,145,201,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
