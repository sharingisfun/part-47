It opens with Rihanna driving a Ferrari F430 into a garage. Rihanna and several other girls start working in the car mechanic garage in a suggestive manner, before slamming the hoods down on cue with the first &quot;Shut Up and Drive&quot; part of the lyrics. The video then cuts to a scene where a 1969 Ford Mustang and extensively modified Skoda Rapid are preparing to race. Rihanna and her friends show up, and Rihanna proceeds to flirt with the two race car drivers through the open windows of their cars at the starting line which shows how much taller she is than the two men. She then directs the drivers to &quot;Shut Up and Drive&quot;, and they take off. The next scene shows Rihanna performing with her band. Throughout the video, Rihanna is also shown in the car garage, and walking around the race yard.\n\nThe video was shot in a makeshift junkyard in Prague, Czech Republic, hence the large amount of junked European cars on set and the Czech registration plate on the cars; premiered on MTV&amp;#039;s Total Request Live on July 4, 2007. On July 9, 2007, it debuted on the TRL countdown at number ten for the first time, has been on the countdown for thirty days and so far has peaked at number four as of August 20, 2007.\n\nPortions of the video were interspersed with NASCAR Nextel Cup race footage for use in ESPN&amp;#039;s coverage of the 2007 Pennsylvania 500.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b03739b0a6b07ac75e6e8965794611d15ea8722f","amp;dn":"Rihanna+-+Shut+Up+And+Drive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b03739b0a6b07ac75e6e8965794611d15ea8722f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,55,57,176,166,176,122,199,94,110,137,101,121,70,17,209,94,168,114,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
