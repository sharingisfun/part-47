His childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), now a military tribune, \narrives as the new commanding officer of the Roman garrison. Ben-Hur and Messala \nare happy to reunite after years apart, but politics divide them; Messala \nbelieves in the glory of Rome and its imperial power, while Ben-Hur is devoted \nto his faith and the freedom of the Jewish people. Messala asks Ben-Hur for \nnames of Jews who criticize the Roman government; Ben-Hur counsels his \ncountrymen against rebellion but refuses to name names, and the two part in \nanger.\nBen-Hur, his mother Miriam (Martha Scott), and sister Tirzah (Cathy O'Donnell) \nwelcome their loyal slave Zaimonides (Sam Jaffe) and his daughter Esther (Haya \nHarareet), who is preparing for an arranged marriage. Ben-Hur gives Esther her \nfreedom as a wedding present, and the two realize they are in love with each \nother.\nDuring the parade for the new governor of Judea, Valerius Gratus, a tile falls \nfrom the roof of Ben-Hur's house and startles the governor's horse, which throws \nGratus off, nearly killing him. Although Messala knows it was an accident, he \ncondemns Ben-Hur to the galleys, and imprisons his mother and sister, to \nintimidate the restive Jewish populace by punishing the family of a known friend \nand prominent citizen. Ben-Hur swears to return and take revenge. En route to \nthe sea, he is denied water when his slave gang arrives at Nazareth. As Ben-Hur \ncollapses in despair, a local carpenter whose face is hidden from the viewing \naudience, but who is obviously Jesus, gives him water and renews his will to \nsurvive.\nAfter three years as a galley slave, Ben-Hur is assigned to the flagship of \nConsul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), assigned to destroy a fleet of Macedonian \npirates. As slave &quot;Number 41,&quot; Ben-Hur's self-discipline and resolve are noticed \nby the commander who offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. But, \nBen-Hur declines, declaring that God will aid him.\nAs Arrius prepares for battle, he orders the rowers chained but Ben-Hur to be \nleft free. Arrius's galley is rammed and sunk, but Ben-Hur unchains other \nrowers, escapes and saves Arrius's life and, since Arrius believes the battle \nended in defeat, prevents him from committing suicide. Arrius is credited with \nthe Roman fleet's victory, and in gratitude petitions Tiberius Julius Caesar \nAugustus (George Relph) to drop all charges against Ben-Hur, adopting him as his \nson. With regained freedom and wealth, Ben-Hur learns Roman ways and becomes a \nchampion charioteer, but longs for his family and homeland.\nWhile returning to Judea, Ben-Hur meets Balthasar (Finlay Currie) and his host, \nArab sheik Ilderim (Hugh Griffith), who owns four magnificent white Arabian \nhorses. Ilderim introduces Ben-Hur to his &quot;children&quot; and asks him to drive \nIlderim's quadriga in the upcoming race before the new Judean governor, Pontius \nPilate (Frank Thring). Ben-Hur declines, but hears that champion charioteer \nMessala will compete; as Ilderim observes, &quot;There is no law in the arena. Many \nare killed.&quot;\nBen-Hur learns that Esther's arranged marriage did not occur and that she is \nstill in love with him. He visits Messala and offers to forget Messala's \nbetrayal in exchange for freeing his mother and sister, but the Romans discover \nthat Miriam and Tirzah contracted leprosy during their five years in prison and \nexpel them from the city. They beg Esther to conceal their condition from \nBen-Hur, so she tells him that his mother and sister have died in prison.\nEnraged, and seeking his vengeance, Ben-Hur enters the race. Messala drives a \n&quot;Pict Chariot,&quot; with blades on the hubs, such chariots were believed to have \noriginally been designed by the Persians to destroy the legs of soldiers in \nbattle but here ostensibly designed to tear apart competing chariots. Such \nchariots were believed to have been used by the Picts in battles against the \ninvading Romans in Britain ref Boudica Queen of the Icenae. The part of sheikh \nIlderin is played by Welshman Hugh Griffith whose Welsh accent saying &quot;Pict&quot; may \nbe mistaken by some for &quot;Greek&quot;. There is no evidence that the Greeks ever used \nbladed chariot hubs. In the violent and grueling race, Messala attempts to \ndestroy Ben-Hur's chariot but destroys his own instead; Messala is trampled and \nmortally wounded, while Ben-Hur wins the race. Before dying, Messala tells \nBen-Hur that &quot;the race is not over&quot; and that he can find his mother and sister \n&quot;...in the Valley of the Lepers, if you can recognize them.&quot;\nThe film is subtitled &quot;A Tale of the Christ&quot;, and it is at this point that Jesus \nChrist reappears. Esther is moved by the Sermon on the Mount. She tells Ben-Hur \nabout it, but he will not be consoled; blaming Roman rule ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ not Messala ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for \nhis family's fate, Ben-Hur rejects his patrimony and citizenship, and plans \nviolence against the Empire. Learning that Tirzah is dying, Ben-Hur and Esther \ntake her and Miriam to see Jesus Christ, but they cannot get near Him; his trial \nhas begun, with Pilate washing his hands of responsibility for Jesus Christ's \nfate. Recognizing Jesus Christ from their earlier encounter in Nazareth, Ben-Hur \nattempts to return the long-ago favor by giving Jesus water during His march to \nCalvary but guards pull them apart.\nBen-Hur witnesses the Crucifixion. Miriam and Tirzah are healed by a miracle, as \nare Ben-Hur's heart and soul. He tells Esther that as he heard Jesus Christ talk \nof forgiveness while on the cross, &quot;I felt His voice take the sword out of my \nhand.&quot; The film ends with an emotional reunion between Ben-Hur and his mother \nand sister, followed by a scene of the empty crosses of Calvary and a shepherd \nleading his flock.\n[edit] CastCharlton Heston as Judah Ben-Hur\n  Stephen Boyd as Messala\n  Martha Scott as Miriam\n  Cathy O'Donnell as Tirzah Bat-Hur\n  Haya Harareet as Esther Bat-Simonides\n  Sam Jaffe as Simonides\n  Jack Hawkins as Quintus Arrius\n  Terence Longdon as Drusus\n  Hugh Griffith as Sheik Ilderim\n  Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate\n  Claude Heater (uncredited) as Jesus\n  Marina Berti as Flavia\n  Jose Greci (uncredited) as Mary\n  Laurence Payne (uncredited) as Joseph\n  Richard Hale (uncredited) as Gaspar\n  John Le Mesurier (uncredited) as Chariot Race Surgeon\n  Reginald Lal Singh as Melchior\n  Michael Dugan (uncredited) as a seaman\n  Finlay Currie as Balthasar/Narrator\n[edit] MusicThe film score was composed and conducted by MiklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³zsa, who \nscored most of MGM's epics. RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³zsa won his third Academy Award for his work on \nthe film. The soundtrack is one of the most popular motion picture scores ever \nwritten, and is listed on the AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores. The entire \ntwo-and-a-half hour score has been issued on a 2-CD Rhino Entertainment set.\n[edit] Production[edit] FinancingBen-Hur was an extremely expensive production, \nrequiring 300 sets scattered over 340 acres (1.4 kmÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²). The $15 million \nproduction was a gamble made by MGM to save itself from bankruptcy; the gamble \npaid off when it earned a total of $90 million worldwide.\n[edit] Aspect ratio \nThe chariot race scene, illustrating the extremely wide aspect ratio used \n(2.76:1).The movie was filmed in a process known as &quot;MGM Camera 65&quot;, 65 mm \nnegative stock from which was made a 70 mm anamorphic print with an aspect ratio \nof 2.76:1, one of the widest prints ever made, having a width of almost three \ntimes its height. An anamorphic lens which produced a 1.25X compression was used \nalong with a 65 mm negative (whose normal aspect ratio was 2.20:1) to produce \nthis extremely wide aspect ratio. This allowed for spectacular panoramic shots \nin addition to six-channel audio. In practice, however, &quot;Camera 65&quot; prints were \nshown in an aspect ratio of 2.5:1 on most screens, so that theaters were not \nrequired to install new, wider screens or use less than the full height of \nscreens already installed.\n[edit] Casting and actingMany other actors were offered the role of Ben-Hur \nbefore Charlton Heston. Burt Lancaster claimed he turned down the role of \nBen-Hur because he &quot;didn't like the violent morals in the story&quot;.[citation \nneeded] Paul Newman turned it down because he said he didn't have the legs to \nwear a tunic.[citation needed] Rock Hudson and Leslie Nielsen were also offered \nthe role.[citation needed] Kirk Douglas was interested in taking the role, but \nwas turned down in favor of Heston. This inspired Douglas to make Spartacus a \nyear later.[1]\nOut of respect, and consistent with Lew Wallace's stated preference, the face of \nJesus is not shown. He was played by opera singer Claude Heater, who received no \ncredit for his only film role.\nIn an interview for the 1995 documentary The Celluloid Closet, screenwriter Gore \nVidal asserts that he persuaded Wyler to direct Stephen Boyd to create a veiled \nhomoerotic subtext between Messala and Ben-Hur. Vidal says he wanted to help \nexplain Messala's extreme reaction to Ben-Hur's refusal to name his fellow Jews \nto a Roman officer, and suggested to Wyler that Messala and Ben-Hur were lovers \nor spouses who'd had a falling out, so that Messala's vindictiveness would be \nmotivated by his feeling of rejection. Since the Hollywood production code would \nnot permit this, the idea would have to be implied by the actors, and Vidal \nsuggested to Wyler that he direct Stephen Boyd to play the role that way, but \nnot tell Heston. Vidal claims that Wyler took his advice, and that the results \ncan be seen in the film.[citation needed]\n[edit] Galley sequenceThe original design for the boat Ben-Hur is enslaved upon \nwas so heavy that it couldn't float. The scene therefore had to be filmed in a \nstudio, but another problem remained: the cameras didn't fit inside, so the boat \nwas cut in half and made able to be wider or narrower on demand. The next \nproblem was that the oars were too long, so those were cut too; however, this \nmade it look unrealistic, because the oars were too easy to row; so weights were \nadded to the ends.\nDuring filming, director Wyler noticed that one of the extras was missing a \nhand. He had the man's stump covered in false blood, with a false bone \nprotruding from it, to add realism to the scene when the galley is rammed. Wyler \nmade similar use of another extra who was missing a foot.\nThe galley sequence includes the successive commands from Arrius, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBattle speed, \nHortator... Attack speed... Ramming speed!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The word hortator is no longer in \nuse, and is notably absent from most modern dictionaries. It was a Latin word \nthat on a ship meant ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œchief of the rowersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhe who has command over the \nrowersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½,[2] and likely has roots in the Latin verb hortor (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œto exhort, \nencourageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). The command &quot;Ramming speed, Hortator!&quot;, which is widely remembered \nand parodied, never occurs.\nThe galley sequence is purely fictional, as the Roman navy, in contrast to its \nearly modern counterparts, did not employ convicts as galley slaves.[3]\n[edit] Chariot raceThe chariot race in Ben-Hur was directed by Andrew Marton, a \nHollywood director who often acted as second unit director on other people's \nfilms. Even by current standards, it is considered to be one of the most \nspectacular action sequences ever filmed.[who?] Filmed at CinecittÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Studios \noutside Rome long before the advent of computer-generated effects, it took over \nthree months to complete, using 15,000 extras on the largest film set ever \nbuilt, some 18 acres (73,000 m2).[citation needed] Eighteen chariots were built, \nhalf being used for practice. The race took five weeks to film. Tour buses \nvisited the set every hour.\nThe section in the middle of the circus, the spina, is a known feature of \ncircuses, although its size may be exaggerated to aid filmmaking. The golden \ndolphin lap counter was a feature of the Circus Maximus in Rome.\n      Theme of Ben-Hur\n\n      composed by MiklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³zsa\n\n\n\n      Problems listening to this file? See media help.\n\nCharlton Heston spent four weeks learning how to drive a chariot. He was taught \nby the stunt crew, who offered to teach the entire cast, but Heston and Boyd \nwere the only ones who took them up on the offer (Boyd had to learn in just two \nweeks, due to his late casting). At the beginning of the chariot race, Heston \nshook the reins and nothing happened; Aldebaran, AltaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯r, Antares and Rigel, the \nfour horses named after celestial stars, remained motionless. Finally someone \nway up on top of the set yelled, &quot;Giddy-up!&quot; The horses then roared into action, \nand Heston was flung backward off the chariot.[citation needed]\nTo give the scene more impact and realism, three lifelike dummies were placed at \nkey points in the race to give the appearance of men being run over by chariots. \nMost notable is the stand-in dummy for Stephen Boyd's Messala that gets tangled \nup under the horses, getting battered by their hooves. This resulted in one of \nthe most grisly fatal injuries in motion picture history up until then, and \nshocked audiences.[citation needed]\nUnfortunately, one lack of authenticity missed by the director was the close-up \nof the knives fitted to the wheels of Messala's chariot clearly showing the \nknife blades electrically welded to the hub plates, a process not in use until \nthe 20th century.\nThere are several urban legends surrounding the chariot sequence, one of which \nstates that a stuntman died during filming. Stuntman Nosher Powell claims in his \nautobiography, &quot;We had a stunt man killed in the third week, and it happened \nright in front of me. You saw it, too, because the cameras kept turning and it's \nin the movie&quot;.[4] There is no conclusive evidence to back up Powell's claim and \nit has been adamantly denied by director William Wyler, who states that neither \nman nor horse was injured in the famous scene. The movie's stunt director, \nYakima Canutt, stated that no serious injuries or deaths occurred during \nfilming.[5]\nAnother urban legend states that a red Ferrari can be seen during the chariot \nrace; the book Movie Mistakes claims this is a myth.[6] (Heston, in the DVD \ncommentary track, mentions a third urban legend that is not true: That he wore a \nwristwatch. He points out that he was wearing leather bracers right up to the \nelbow.)\nHowever, one of the best-remembered moments in the race came from a near-fatal \naccident. When Judah's chariot jumps another chariot which has crashed in its \npath, the charioteer is seen to be almost thrown from his mount and only just \nmanages to hang on and climb back in to continue the race. In reality, while the \njump was planned, the character being flipped into the air was not planned, and \nstuntman Joe Canutt, son of stunt director Yakima Canutt, was considered \nfortunate to escape with only a minor chin injury. Nonetheless, when director \nWyler intercut the long shot of Canutt's leap with a close-up of Heston \nclambering back into his chariot, this resulted in one of the most memorable \nmoments.[7]\n[edit] Differences between novel and filmThere are several differences between \nthe original novel and the film. The changes made serve to make the film's \nstoryline more immediately dramatic.\n  In the novel, Messala is seriously, but not fatally, injured in the chariot \n  race. In the movie, Messala falls victim to an accident that is caused by his \n  own attempts to sabotage Ben-Hur, and he dies from the wounds sustained from \n  the accident. In the book, Messala plots to have Ben-Hur murdered in revenge, \n  but his plans go awry. It is revealed at the end of the novel that Iras (who \n  is Messala's mistress and does not appear in the 1959 film) had murdered \n  Messala in a fit of anger about five years after the chariot race.\n  The film has the chariot race taking place in Jerusalem, the novel however has \n  it taking place in Antioch.\n  In the novel, Ben-Hur becomes a convert to Christianity before, rather than \n  after, the Crucifixion, and he does not display the harsh bitterness that he \n  does in the William Wyler film. Similarly, the healing of Ben-Hur's mother and \n  sister takes place earlier in the book, not immediately after the death of \n  Christ.\n  In the novel, the character of Quintus Arrius was acquainted with Ben-Hur's \n  father, but in the movie there was no such prior association between the \n  Arrius and Hur families. In the novel, Arrius dies and passes his property and \n  title on to Ben-Hur prior to Ben-Hur's return home. No mention of Arrius's \n  death is made in the 1959 film, so presumably he is still alive at film's end.\n  The novel ends about 30 years after the chariot race, with the Ben-Hur family \n  living in Misenum, Italy. While in Antioch, Ben-Hur learns that Sheik Ilderim \n  (who does not die in any of the film versions of the novel) had bequeathed him \n  a large amount of money. At about the same time he learns of the persecution \n  of Christians in Rome by Emperor Nero, Ben-Hur helps establish the Catacomb of \n  San Calixto so that the Christian community will have a place to worship \n  freely. The movie, however, ends almost immediately after the Crucifixion of \n  Christ and the healing of Ben-Hur's mother and sister. This is presumably only \n  a few years after the chariot race, not thirty years afterward. None of the \n  characters (except Balthasar, who appears in the Nativity Scene) is shown to \n  age in the film.\n[edit] Box office performanceBen-Hur earned $17,300,000 at the box office.[8] It \nwas the highest money earning film of 1959.[9]\n[edit] Awards and honorsThe film won an unprecedented 11 Academy Awards, a \nnumber matched only by Titanic in 1998 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of \nthe King in 2004.\n  Best Motion Picture;\n  Best Director for William Wyler;\n  Best Leading Actor for Charlton Heston;\n  Best Supporting Actor for Hugh Griffith;\n  Best Set Decoration, Color for Edward C.

Because of the film's length, the entire \nevening's regular CBS lineup, beginning with 60 Minutes, was scrapped for just \nthat one night, one of the few times in the history of CBS that 60 Minutes was \npreempted for a movie special.
