In quick succession, he meets two women: Sandra, the daughter of his parents' business associates, frank, direct, sensual, Jewish like Leonard; and, his neighbor Michelle, mercurial, rootless, fun, blond, unattainable. Michelle is in love with a married man and cries on Leonard's shoulder; Sandra wants to save him. Is Leonard willing to risk losing Sandra's fidelity for the moments Michelle's moods swing toward him? Can this end well?\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0bd1bae3ee75742eaf7848b77f944246f4bc4e4","amp;dn":"Two+Lovers+2008+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0bd1bae3ee75742eaf7848b77f944246f4bc4e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,189,27,174,62,231,87,66,234,247,132,139,119,249,68,36,111,75,196,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
