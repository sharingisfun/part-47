With chapter titles such as Adolf Hitler: Man of the Left and Brave New Village: Hillary Clinton and the Meaning of Liberal FascismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Goldberg argues that fascism has always been a phenomenon of the left. This is Goldberg&amp;#039;s first book, and he wisely curbs his wry National Review style. Goldberg&amp;#039;s study of the conceptual overlap between fascism and ideas emanating from the environmental movement, Hollywood, the Democratic Party and what he calls other left-wing organs is shocking and hilarious. He lays low such lights of liberal history as Margaret Sanger, apparently a radical eugenicist, and JFK, whose cult of personality, according to Goldberg, reeks of fascist political theater. Much of this will be music to conservatives&amp;#039; ears, but other readers may be stopped cold by the parallels Goldberg draws between Nazi Germany and the New Deal. The book&amp;#039;s tone suffers as it oscillates between revisionist historical analyses and the application of fascist themes to American popular culture; nonetheless, the controversial arc Goldberg draws from Mussolini to The Matrix is well-researched, seriously arguedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and funny.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:102d386e0ee4fd19253c0190cef0ccfdbc366a7a","amp;dn":"Jonah+Goldberg+Liberal+Fascism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"102d386e0ee4fd19253c0190cef0ccfdbc366a7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,45,56,110,14,228,253,25,37,60,1,144,206,240,204,253,188,54,106,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
