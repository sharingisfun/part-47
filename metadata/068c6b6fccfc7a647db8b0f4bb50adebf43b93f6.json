You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:068c6b6fccfc7a647db8b0f4bb50adebf43b93f6","amp;dn":"Windows.7.Loader.v1.8.2-DAZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"068c6b6fccfc7a647db8b0f4bb50adebf43b93f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,140,107,111,204,252,122,100,125,184,176,244,187,80,173,235,244,59,147,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
