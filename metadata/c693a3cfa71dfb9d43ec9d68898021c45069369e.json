Its cancellation was announced, but then a shift in power at Fox and outcry from the fans led to a reversal of that decision and the making of a third season, after which it was canceled again. Reruns on Adult Swim drove interest in the show up, and the DVD releases did quite well, selling over 2.2 million copies in one year, which renewed network interest. Family Guy returned to production in 2004, making four more seasons (for a total of seven) and a straight-to-DVD movie, Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story. The show celebrated its official 100th episode during its sixth season in autumn of 2007, resulting in the show's syndication. The show is contracted to continue producing episodes until 2012.\n\nFormat: avi\nsubtitle: str, castellano\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c693a3cfa71dfb9d43ec9d68898021c45069369e","amp;dn":"Family+Guy+Season+1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6+and+7+with+sub.str","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c693a3cfa71dfb9d43ec9d68898021c45069369e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,147,163,207,167,29,251,157,67,236,157,104,137,128,33,196,80,105,54,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
