With the terrible increase in mutilated corpses to examine, the highly regarded police surgeon Dr. Thomas Bond has lost the ability to sleep. True, a growing dependency on opium affords him some solace in his loneliest and most desperate hours, but he also fears the grip of the drug.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af9e171598e116390ced72d5c3512f97a94bf222","amp;dn":"Sarah+Pinborough-Mayhem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af9e171598e116390ced72d5c3512f97a94bf222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,158,23,21,152,225,22,57,12,237,114,213,195,81,47,151,169,75,242,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
