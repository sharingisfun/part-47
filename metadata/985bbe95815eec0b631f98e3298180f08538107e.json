With his Comedy Central special debuting on Sunday night (03/08/09), the British comedian sure hopes the answer to that question is yes. Wildly popular in the UK for his stand-up, hosting gigs, andÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦erÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦extra-curricular activities, Brand isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t exactly a household name in the US. At least not yet. The man who won The SunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prestigious ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShagger of the YearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ award three years straight is probably best known here for two things: stealing nearly every scene in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and a controversial gig hosting the VMAs.\n\nHowever, neither of those brought Brand the prominence he seeks. Stating that his personality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdoesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really work without fame,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Brand is on an all-out mission to conquer the American audience. The question is: Will the US be interested in Brand? Sure, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s smart, hilarious, and pretty easy on the eyes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- but there are loads of British exports, from comedy to music to film, that just donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take off when they cross the pond. Sometimes the States just donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get it.\n\nBut, I think if ever there was a time for Brand to hit it off in the US, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s now. The Comedy Central special, which looks to be a nice showcase for his rapid-fire stand-up, should put the comedian in front of a crowd that actually will get it. Sure, his VMAs gig was widely panned, but letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s face it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- all the cool kids stopped watching MTV ages ago. And Americans do love a good scandal, something Brand ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- fresh off a swirl of controversy leading to his BBC radio showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cancellation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- is no stranger to.\n\nIf you want to know more about BrandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scandalous past, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d highly recommend checking out his autobiography, My Booky Wook, released in the US on March 10. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll admit, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not often one for all that reading stuff, but when I saw the first line of this one ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOn the morning of April Fools Day 2005, I woke up in a sexual addiction treatment centre in a suburb of Philadelphia.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- I knew IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d actually finish it.\n\nThe bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a good read, but at the very least, do yourself a favor and check out BrandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Comedy Central special this Sunday at 10:00pm. We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have anybody quite like this here ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ find out why itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time we should.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:985bbe95815eec0b631f98e3298180f08538107e","amp;dn":"Russell+Brand+in+New+York+City+-+Comedy+%7ERecyclethc%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"985bbe95815eec0b631f98e3298180f08538107e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,91,190,149,129,94,236,11,99,31,152,227,41,129,128,240,133,56,16,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
