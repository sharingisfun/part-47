Who built them, how were they\n              built and why? Experts across Egypt are discovering\n              new information that sheds light on the Ancient\n              Egyptians' pyramids and how they evolved. One theory\n              poses that King Sneferu's Bent Pyramid was not a\n              mistake. Recent discoveries show how the pyramids\n              evolved from a mound of rocks and sand to flat,\n              rectangular mastabas, to the pyramid shape, so\n              famously exhibited in the Great pyramid of Khufu and\n              beyond. Now the archaeology is being taken a stage\n              further with new technology. The film shows how the\n              next generation of archaeologists are finally piecing\n              together the secret pyramid code which might have been\n              used by the Egyptians.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        GREETS:\n                    - FQM - CTU - REVEiLLE - XOXO -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af0ef1a1b1ce342a15e04246659f3cbc47d77820","amp;dn":"Egypt.Unwrapped.S02E04.The.Pyramid.Code.720p.HDTV.x264-DHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af0ef1a1b1ce342a15e04246659f3cbc47d77820","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,14,241,161,177,206,52,42,21,224,66,70,101,159,60,188,71,215,120,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
