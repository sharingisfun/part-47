Some in Congress are warning against reacting too quickly; others want conditions that protect homeowners, increase oversight, and limit the compensation of corporate executives.\n\nBut the number one question on the minds of Americans: How will this affect me? This week, NOW on PBS goes inside the round-the-clock efforts in Washington to craft a bailout plan of monumental proportions.\n\nNOW's cameras follow Damon Silvers, an associate general counsel at the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest federation of labor unions, as he works to get help for working Americans in addition to bailing out financial firms in distress. Silvers, an architect of the major provisions Congressional Democrats are pushing for in the bill, provides key insight on the stake ordinary working Americans have in the fate of this proposal, and on what comes next.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23af2a05fffea824d773c0ffb6487951a9497d6c","amp;dn":"PBS-+NOW-+Behind+the+Bailout","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23af2a05fffea824d773c0ffb6487951a9497d6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,175,42,5,255,254,168,36,215,115,192,255,182,72,121,81,169,73,125,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
