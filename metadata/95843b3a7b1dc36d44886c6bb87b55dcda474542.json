It may be disconcerting to some to have Rick Springfield, Irene Cara, Herbie Hancock, and Sheena Easton performing their early-&amp;#039;80s hits next to Amy Grant, Melissa Etheridge, Seal, and Sting, but overall, the music isn&amp;#039;t all that dissimilar, making it a worthy entry in the series. ~ Steve Huey, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95843b3a7b1dc36d44886c6bb87b55dcda474542","amp;dn":"VA+-+Grammy%5C%27s+Greatest+Moments+Volume+IV+-+1994","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95843b3a7b1dc36d44886c6bb87b55dcda474542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,132,59,58,123,29,195,109,68,136,108,107,184,123,85,220,218,71,69,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
