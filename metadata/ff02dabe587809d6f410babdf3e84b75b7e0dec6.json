The song was released as the second single from the band's third studio album Day &amp; Age on November 4, 2008, as a digital download on iTunes, and as 7&quot; and promo CD in the US, Canada and UK. It has been released to radio in Australia and has gone into regular rotation on Triple J. This song was number 17 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2008.\n\nThe group began performing the song at shows during their Summer 2008 tour and played it as part of a two-song set on the October 4, 2008 episode of Saturday Night Live. They also performed the song on November 4, 2008 on BBC2's Later... with Jools Holland.\n\nThe song was released as a downloadable track for the music video game series Rock Band on November 25, 2008.\n\nThe music video shows Brandon Flowers walking around a party in progress, happening on a strange tiered structure adorned with long white vertical lights. Many humanoid creatures (all dressed up in very colourful, carnival-like costumes) are dancing, occasionally as a group, but usually individually. Throughout the video more of the structure is revealed, until we can clearly see that it is in the middle of a wide open space, surrounded by the camera crew filming the video.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff02dabe587809d6f410babdf3e84b75b7e0dec6","amp;dn":"The+Killers+-+Spaceman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff02dabe587809d6f410babdf3e84b75b7e0dec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,2,218,190,88,120,9,214,244,16,186,189,243,232,75,117,183,224,222,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
