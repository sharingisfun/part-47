But today films are like fashion, furniture, and food: you can choose what to enjoy. Movies finally fit into our schedules.\nSo here is the first movie guide tailored to the way we actually watch movies. Whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Halloween, the brink of baseballÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Opening Day, or a Saturday evening with no babysitter; whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re bracing for a business trip, feeling nostalgic for the 1960s, or simply in need of a dose of optimism (or apocalypse), Flickipedia will steer you to over 1,300 films that will fit your movie-viewing appetite perfectly.\nEntertaining as well as informative, Flickipedia recommends many movies that you may not be familiar with, while acknowledging the tried-and-true standbys and popular classics. Every step in life provokes different emotions, and Flickipedia is here with suggestions to cover the waterfront.\n\nPaperback: 352 pages\nPublisher: Chicago Review Press (October 1, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1556527144\nISBN-13: 978-1556527142\n \n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
