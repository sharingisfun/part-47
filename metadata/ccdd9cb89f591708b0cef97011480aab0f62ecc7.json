Harrowing actuality filmed in the immediate aftermath\n      combines with moving testimony from the spectrum of people\n      affected in the wake of violent death. Filmed over eighteen\n      months, this epic documentary is the BBC's most ambitious film\n      to date about youth violence.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
