It is unlike anything youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever heard. People will call it many things. Few will get it right. This is Death Vessel.\n\nDeath VesselÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut album Stay Close was released in 2005 to critical acclaim. Since that albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s release Death Vessel has toured with Iron &amp; Wine, Low, Jose Gonzalez, and The Books, among others. Recorded with longtime producer/collaborator Pete Donnelly (The Figgs) at his New Jersey studio, and various locales across the northeast, Nothing Is Precious Enough for Us is Death VesselÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Sub Pop debut. While in recent years Joel has toured primarily as a solo performer, and the songs are inarguably mesmerizing and relevant in that setting, on record they take on a new life, thanks to his and DonnellyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inspired, and often unusual, arrangements, and the contributions of numerous friends and players. The album exudes a unique, wide-scope ambition. Its musical reach is fully extendedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½-deep into the past, grounded in the present and nodding to the future. Owing to the gritty avarice of JoelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s singular spirit, voice and musicality, the songs sound as progressive, experimental and modern as they do antique and old-world. The music is haunting and spiritual, mysterious and kind, ageless and contemporary, soulful and psychedelic. In short, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s where the requiem meets rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ roll.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNow I am versed in silence/my throat hurts, not from yelling but from holding back,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Joel sings on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlock My Eye,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s opening track. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ok, because the music speaks for itself. And nothing ever sounded so loud, and so clear.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d806d790c2c09e78c1619e163efd5859de1a4e56","amp;dn":"Death+Vessel...Nothing+Is+Precious+Enough+for+Us%282008%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d806d790c2c09e78c1619e163efd5859de1a4e56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,6,215,144,194,192,158,120,193,97,158,22,62,253,88,89,222,26,78,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
