Keyboardist Joanna Newsom is known most for her harp playing, but she is quoted as saying, &quot;It's totally different. I usually don't tell people about The Pleased if they know me from the harp. And if they are there to see The Pleased, I usually don't tell them about the harp. I am nervous that these people will expect something similar.&quot; And different it is. The music has a mainstreem alt/modern pop sound that is not expected from the harp-plucking, high-voiced girl.\n\nMy other torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kras77&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kras77&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87e84787d1e15e9381061c466cf7198c6023c128","amp;dn":"the+pleased+-+2+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87e84787d1e15e9381061c466cf7198c6023c128","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,232,71,135,209,225,94,147,129,6,28,70,108,247,25,140,96,35,193,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
