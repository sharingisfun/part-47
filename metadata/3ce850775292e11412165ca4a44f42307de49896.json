It is scheduled for release on September 12, 2008 by Warner Bros. Records. The album will be the band&amp;#039;s first to feature current bassist Robert Trujillo, and the first to be produced by Rick Rubin. Death Magnetic also marks the first time in the band&amp;#039;s history in which all band members contributed to each song on an album. It will be their first studio album released through Warner Bros., although they still remain with Warner Music Group, which also owns Elektra Records, the band&amp;#039;s previous label.\n\nSince May 12, 2008 (2008-05-12), the album has been heavily promoted on its specially dedicated website, entitled Mission: Metallica, which features daily updates of exclusive, behind-the-scenes sneak previews with photos and video clips from the studio. The original logo used by the band, which had been discontinued following the 1993 release Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge in favor of more modernized band logos, made its return on Death Magnetic.\n\nInfo About My Releases: The LAME codec will never be used by me on any release; it is outdated, especially when compared to such a great codec such as the Nero Digital Audio Codec. It is known for ultra-high compression ratios that blow LAME away...for example, an AAC file at 128 kbps will be of higher quality than a MP3 at 192 kbps. I encode all songs at a VBR [Variable Bit Rate] at the quality level Q=0.79 and the quality definitely can be heard by any audio lover. Turn it up as loud as the CD; you will hear no distortion like with an MP3. Also, each track is tagged by me personally, and pre-organized for you so there is no mess to clean up with the tags. Just add the files to your favorite music player, and hit play. Or go play them in your car from you iPod or Zune player and impress your friends. After a few UnisonBand releases you will never look for a MP3 release again! Enjoy, and remember Release-Lounge RG=Quality!\n\nFinal Words: This album rocks, there is no question. However this is a rip of the PROMO Disc, which is rumored to lack a certain production value on the final mastering process. The sound quality is very rough, but this is the way it is suppose to be. If the retail release has better sound quality, I will release that one as well, but if it is the same we will know that this was that sound Metallica was going for on the album.\n\nTracked By: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bandit.ukb-kvcd.com:5600/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bandit.ukb-kvcd.com:5600/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nInfo Hash: 3CE850775292E11412165CA4A44F42307DE49896","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce850775292e11412165ca4a44f42307de49896","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+Death+Magnetic+%5B2008%5D+%5BPROMO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce850775292e11412165ca4a44f42307de49896","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,232,80,119,82,146,225,20,18,22,92,164,164,79,66,48,125,228,152,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
