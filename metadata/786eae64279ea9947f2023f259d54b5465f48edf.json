The album itself reached #28. Produced by Ron Nevison, the album was arranged with the help of Peter Wolf, who had worked with Grace Slick on her solo album. Wolf also contributed keyboard and synthesizer work to the album, although not an official part of the band. \n\nAs the album was being recorded, Paul Kantner became frustrated with the album's direction. Before the sessions came to a close, he stole the master tapes, put them in his car and drove around San Francisco for a few days and wouldn't bring them back until the band mixed the album in a way more to his liking. Shortly after release of the album, Paul left the band.\n\nThis is a rare and difficult to find release.  This rip is from my Japanese import.\n\nAll of my rips are from the original CD and have embedded cover art.  Enjoy!  Please feel free to ask for requests.  If I have them, I will up them.\n\n\n1.&quot;Layin' It On The Line&quot; (Craig Chaquico / Mickey Thomas) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n2.&quot;No Way Out&quot; (Peter Wolf / Ina Wolf) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n3.&quot;Sorry Me, Sorry You&quot; (Pete Sears / Jeannette Sears) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n4.&quot;Live And Let Live&quot; (Pete Sears / Jeannette Sears) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n5.&quot;Connection&quot; (Paul Kantner / Mickey Thomas) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n6.&quot;Rose Goes To Yale&quot; (Paul Kantner / Ronnie Gilbert) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56\n7.&quot;Magician&quot; (Grace Slick / Peter Wolf) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n8.&quot;Assassin&quot; (Pete Sears / Jeannette Sears) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n9.&quot;Shining In The Moonlight&quot; (Craig Chaquico / Mickey Thomas) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n10.&quot;Showdown&quot; (Grace Slick) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n11.&quot;Champion&quot; (Paul Kantner / Ronnie Gilbert) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:786eae64279ea9947f2023f259d54b5465f48edf","amp;dn":"Jefferson+Starship+-+Nuclear+Furniture+%28320k+MP3%29+%7Bsolstars%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"786eae64279ea9947f2023f259d54b5465f48edf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,110,174,100,39,158,169,148,127,32,35,242,89,213,75,84,101,244,142,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
