Geneszorr's forces are in full retreat! Defeated on the now-destroyed planet Gallia, his armies withdraw in full disarray. The Battle Girlz of Sasa Rai have won! Or have they? Does Geneszorr have one last card to play, or was this his plan all along? Secretly entering Arlan at the end of his strategic retreat, Geneszorr prepares to unleash his full plot upon the planet and its ruler. But Queen Astrenacci takes action together with Sasa Rai, Bryn and the Battle Girlz, and they all gather at Arlan to stop Geneszorr before he unleashes his plans on the unsuspecting world, but do those plans reach even further than just the destruction of Arlan? Plans upon plans, subterfuge upon subterfuge... the layers of secrecy and scheming are finally revealed as both sides clash in one final battle.\n\nThanks goes to Talon for this release.\n\nBattle Girlz #3: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9751615&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9751615&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBattle Girlz #4: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9751673&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9751673&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBattle Girlz #5: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9792206&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9792206&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
