Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. However, MPC-HC (preferably in K-Lite Media Codec Pack) is the recommended. Many updated players have native support for the codec. To play on Android, use MX Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d812480cdc4d1b95eaab18c7b970220c3811bca9","amp;dn":"BrandNewAmateurs+Ryann+Returns+720p+HEVC+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d812480cdc4d1b95eaab18c7b970220c3811bca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,18,72,12,220,77,27,149,234,171,24,199,185,112,34,12,56,17,188,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
