Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop, heavy metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. The band was formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with singer Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston.\n\nThis video was recorded live on Jul 21, 1979 at the Oakland Coliseum Stadium (Oakland, CA) for Bill Grahams Day On The Green #3 which also included: Ted Nugent, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Frank Marino &amp; Mahogany Rush, St.Paradise.\nAlso called &quot;The Monsters Of Rock&quot; show. Aerosmith's set has been bootlegged in video form. This was reputedly the only footage from any of the 1970s Day On The Green concerts to be available (other film footage has been found, but not widely released - Fleetwood Mac from 1976 for one). It was somehow taken from the famous Bill Graham vault sometime in 2006/2007.\n\nThe Band:\n\nSteven Tyler ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead vocals\nJoe Perry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, backing vocals\nBrad Whitford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nTom Hamilton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nJoey Kramer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion\n\nSet List:\n\nBack In The Saddle\nTrain Kept A Rollin\nMama Kin\nBig Ten Inch Record\nReefer Head Woman\nLick And A Promise\nThink About It\nSeasons Of Wither\nI Want Love (Incomplete)\nLord Of The Thighs\nSweet Emotion\nGet The Lead Out (Incomplete)\nWalk This Way (Incomplete)\nDraw The Line (Incomplete)\nSame Old Song And Dance (Incomplete)\nCome Together\nToys In The Attic\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nbrought to you by cheborneck: http://thepiratebay.se/user/cheborneck/\n\nThe Matroska codec pack for Windows Media Player: http://www.divx.com/en/software/divx-plus/codec-pack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:423ea0e599b1ccc11ec91c0d8937e63bf01b6268","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Day+On+The+Green+1979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"423ea0e599b1ccc11ec91c0d8937e63bf01b6268","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,62,160,229,153,177,204,193,30,201,28,13,137,55,230,59,240,27,98,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
