It was the first single to be released from the band's third album, Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know. It achieved international success when released as a single in 1986. The song proved to be more successful in the U.S. and in Japan than in the band's native U.K.; it peaked at #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, whereas the song reached #31 on the UK Singles Chart. In addition, &quot;Brand New Lover&quot; spent two weeks atop the American dance chart in December of 1986. The lyrics describe the singer's desire to leave his current partner for one who is more exciting. His motivation is that he admittedly does not desire a stable relationship with one partner, but rather is &quot;a pleasure seeker.&quot;\n\nDead or Alive are a British New Wave band from Liverpool that rose to popularity during the 1980s, and evolved from the late 1970s band Nightmares in Wax.\n\nThey are best known for their 1985 #1 UK hit single, &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot;.\n\nIn 1987, Dead or Alive released their third album, Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know (UK #27, US #52), also produced by SAW.
