Daniel, who has had to cope with depression following devastating losses in his personal life, is attending his first year of college and struggling with classes, homework and fitting in. \n\nMeanwhile, Kail is striving to get into university: he and his mother consult with his teachers to ensure strategies are in place to help him meet admission requirements, and he takes the decision about medication into his own hands. No matter the issues that ADHD brings - the struggle to concentrate and to inhibit and regulate behaviour, time management, organization - both men are intent on achieving success.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 35s 161ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English\nSubtitles         : None\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 015 Kbps\nAspect            : 576 x 352 (1.636) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 121 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEkolb.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc689f0e806847a49b4fbab2d10ac709a34f663","amp;dn":"TVO-A+Mind+Like+Mine+%282009%29.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc689f0e806847a49b4fbab2d10ac709a34f663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,198,137,240,232,6,132,122,73,180,251,171,45,16,172,112,154,52,246,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
