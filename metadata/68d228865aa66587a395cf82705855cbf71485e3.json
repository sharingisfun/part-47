The most remarkable thing about the Pixies' reunion, 11 years after their acrimonious split - more remarkable than the speed with which their four London shows sold out, or the fact that 75% of the crowd are visibly too young to remember the band first time around - is how deftly the Boston quartet have avoided them all. \n\nWith its squalling riff and biblical imagery, Dead is surely the most obtuse song ever to provoke an audience singalong. A bleak cover of In Heaven, from the soundtrack to Eraserhead, slides into the gorgeously melodic Wave of Mutilation. For all their influence on current rock, the Pixies still sound utterly unique. \n\nReview of THIS gig\n\n[url]http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/jun/03/popandrock.pixies[/url]\n\n\nGuys\n\nIf you're downloading this, it's because you're of a certain age and you're an obscure twat (like me) when it comes to musical preferences, you'll appreciate how hard it can be to find the good stuff. This is the good stuff.\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you leach! I've got a crappy connection, so I'll seed for 10x, then I'm doing the next one!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68d228865aa66587a395cf82705855cbf71485e3","amp;dn":"Live+at+Brixton+Academy+06.02.04+%28Discli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68d228865aa66587a395cf82705855cbf71485e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,210,40,134,90,166,101,135,163,149,207,130,112,88,85,203,247,20,133,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
