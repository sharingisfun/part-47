One hour with news as you do not see it elsewhere.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHeadlines for Jan 31, 2011\n\n- Massive Protests In Egypt Enter Seventh Day; General Strike Called\n- ElBaradei Joins Street Protests, Calls For End of Mubarak Regime\n- New Egyptian VP Tied to CIA Extradordinary Rendition Program\n- Egypt Attempts to Silence Al Jazeera; Cuts Off Internet &amp; Cell Phone Service\n\n\nSpecial reports\n\n- Sharif Abdel Kouddous Live From Egypt: The Rebellion Grows Stronger\n\nMassive protests in Egypt have entered their seventh day as tens of thousands pack into Tahri Square in Cairo. Protesters are vowing to stay in the streets until President Hosni Mubarak resigns. A general strike was called for today and a &quot;million man march&quot; is being organized for Tuesday. We speak with Democracy Now's Senior Producer Sharif Abdel Kouddous who is in Egypt. &quot;This is a popular uprising across all segments of society,&quot; Kouddous says. &quot;People are so fed up with Mubarak, it's hard to describe. They cursed him, they want him to step down. They will not leave the streets of Cairo, the streets of Egypt, until he does.&quot;\n\n\n- Economic Concerns Underpin the Uprising In Egypt\n\nRecent events in Egypt could be an opportunity for the United States to support the people of Egypt, but no Obama administration official has recommended publicly that President Hosni Mubarak should step down. We speak with Samer Shehata, assistant professor of Arab Politics at Georgetown University, about U.S.-Egypt relations and the economic concerns that underpin the ongoing protests. &quot;In Egypt, from 2004 until the present ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ the government and its reforms were applauded in Washington by the World Bank, the IMF and U.S. officials,&quot; Shehata says. &quot;But what all of that masked, what all of that covered, was what was going on at the level of real people and ordinary lives.&quot;\n\n\n- Women Protest Alongside Men in Egyptian Protests Calling for Democracy\n\nRenowned feminist and human rights activist, Nawal El Saadaw, was a political prisoner and exiled from Egypt for years. Now she has returned to Cairo and she joins us to discuss the role of women the last six days of unprecedented protests. She says, &quot;women and girls are besides boys in the streets and we are calling for justice, freedom, equality and real democracy. And I believe the revolution is succeeding.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:535fee83f5a75c657d6986e431270b39849ab763","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+31+jan+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"535fee83f5a75c657d6986e431270b39849ab763","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,95,238,131,245,167,92,101,125,105,134,228,49,39,11,57,132,154,183,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
