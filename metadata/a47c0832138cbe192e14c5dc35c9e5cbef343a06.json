He leans gently \nforward, then falls over in a carefully choreographed drop onto his bed. \nWrestling his body out of his clothes, he struggles to position himself. An \nhour later, comfortable at last, he speed-dials his campaign manager to review \nthe day.\n\nSam is running for mayor.\n\nSam Sullivan was a local curiosity, the quadriplegic city councilor in a \npinstripe suit, with a pipe dream of leading his shattered right wing party \nback to power. Citizen Sam goes deep inside Sullivan&amp;#039;s mayoral campaign to tell \nthe remarkable story behind his rise from obscurity.\n\nAs the campaign begins, Sullivan admits to giving addicts money to buy crack \nand heroin. His opponents call him a do-nothing politician, and a nut. The \nmedia write him off, while everyone tiptoes around the issue of his disability.\n\n6 am. Sam is back on the phone, going over the day&amp;#039;s schedule while he reverses \nthe previous night&amp;#039;s routine, into fresh clothes and then a precarious move \nfrom bed to chair. His partner, Lynn, adjusts his tie and leads him out the \ndoor to his first appointment, a radio debate.\n\nWith unprecedented access, director Joe Moulins blends the rough and tumble of \nthe campaign with intimate moments from Sullivan&amp;#039;s daily life. A brutally frank \nand funny video diary counts down the days to the election. From war room to \nbedroom, Citizen Sam is an unflinching portrait of the one-of-a-kind politician \nwho has become the face of Vancouver on the international stage.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Post Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosted by............: festering leper\n\nPosted to............: alt.binaries.multimedia\n                       alt.binaries.tv\n                       alt.binaries.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.multimedia.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.tv.canadian\n\nRepost Policy........: None, sorry!
