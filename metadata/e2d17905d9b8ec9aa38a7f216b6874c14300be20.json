All of Naruto&amp;#039;s classmates have matured and improved in the ranks, some more than others. Unlike the original series where they only played a minor role, the Akatsuki organization takes on the main antagonistic role in their attempts at world domination.\n\n\nThe plot centrally moves with Naruto fighting with Akatsuki and their plans, with Orochimaru and what happens to Sasuke.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2d17905d9b8ec9aa38a7f216b6874c14300be20","amp;dn":"Naruto+Shippuuden+001-073+%5BJap%5D+%5BEng+Subs%5D-soagg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2d17905d9b8ec9aa38a7f216b6874c14300be20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,209,121,5,217,184,236,154,163,138,127,33,107,104,116,193,67,0,190,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
