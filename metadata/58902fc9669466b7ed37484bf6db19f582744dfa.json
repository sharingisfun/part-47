Rothbard\n\n\nConversion by Liberty-Books\n\n\nThe most powerful case against the American central bank ever written. This work begins with a mini-treatment of money and banking theory, and then plunges right in with the real history of the Federal Reserve System. Rothbard covers the struggle between competing elites and how they converged with the Fed.\n\nRothbard calls for the abolition of the central bank and a restoration of the gold standard. His popular treatment incorporates the best and most up-to-date scholarship on the Fed's origins and effects.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58902fc9669466b7ed37484bf6db19f582744dfa","amp;dn":"%5BMP3%5D+The+Case+Against+The+Fed+by+Murray+N.+Rothbard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58902fc9669466b7ed37484bf6db19f582744dfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,144,47,201,102,148,102,183,237,55,72,75,246,219,25,245,130,116,77,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
