Since I don't have the artwork it is not a TQMP upload.\n\nIn 2007 Verve reissued a number of their classic AT NEWPORT albums with crisply remastered sound to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the famous 1957 Newport Jazz Festival (made famous, in large part, because Verve's Norman Granz recorded most of the artists at the fest and released their sets on his label, making the live jazz album an industry staple). One such reissue is the Oscar Peterson Trio's set, which features a number of standards (including &quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot; and &quot;Autumn in New York&quot;) alongside originals. The iconic pianist is flanked by musicians of equal stature: drummer Jo Jones, saxophonist Sonny Stitt, and trumpeter Roy Eldridge. The set, a glowing dose of vintage post bop, sounds as good today as on its release, if not better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e56a777c9f177e1116152b97db6db9e74a1873de","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson+Trio+-+At+Newport","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e56a777c9f177e1116152b97db6db9e74a1873de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,106,119,124,159,23,126,17,22,21,43,151,219,109,185,231,74,24,115,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
