Under orders to contain the threat that possesses the mammoth at all costs, Special Agents Powers and Whitaker are given 17 hours to kill the mammoth or the entire town will be decimated. They recruit local paleontologist, Dr. Frank Abernathy, to help them hunt the creature down before its rampage of death and destruction gets to the outside world. With the clock ticking and the body count rising, the only chance Dr. Abernathy has of saving his daughter and B-movie fanatic father is to help the agents destroy his life&amp;#039;s work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ca2ec73c8b5b2e720f1c929415e290573d7f146","amp;dn":"Mammoth+%282006%29+aka+%5C%22Outbreak%5C%22+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ca2ec73c8b5b2e720f1c929415e290573d7f146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,162,236,115,200,181,178,231,32,241,201,41,65,94,41,5,115,215,241,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
