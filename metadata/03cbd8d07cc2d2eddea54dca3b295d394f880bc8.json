Low Sing (archive footage)....\n\nAlso included in this torrent is a documentary of the Green Hornet's transport - the Black Beauty, as built by Dean Jefferies using a Chrysler Imperial. \n\nSeveral episodes of the 1966 TV series &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; edited together and released as a feature.\n\nNo, there wasn't any movie made of the Green Hornet, rather, this DVD is a combination of 3 of the television episodes put together. There wasn't any attempt to splice the movie into one long narrative, nor come up with original material like its sibling Batman series (also executive produced by William Dozier).\n\nCreated by George Trendle, the story of the Green Hornet is similar to many other masked vigilantes created before, like Batman (very similar, with their characters wealthy background and the use of a sidekick), the Shadow, and The Lone Ranger. And who can forget that hypnotic and iconic theme song with its blaring trumpets and similarity to the flight of the bumblebee?\n\nVan Williams stars as the Green Hornet, aka Britt Reid, a wealthy man who runs the Sentinel newspaper as well as a television station. Like all rich folks with plenty of money and a deep sense of justice, he investigates crime as his alter ego, the Green Hornet, with his green mask, black hat, and the Hornet's sting, aside from his gun. Naturally, he has a sidekick known as Kato, kung-fu master extraordinaire, played by none other than the best in the business Bruce Lee.\n\nOf course the action sequences all belong to Lee, with his exhibition of martial arts. The Hornet himself fights with the usual fist-only punches like a boxer, but with Kato, the action is spiced up. And that is basically the appeal of The Green Hornet.\n\nIn this DVD, the three stories are forgettable - the first deals with a club whose members develop their own agenda to rid crime, the second has aliens who want to take over and detonate a H-bomb, while the last deals with Chinese Triads. While the stories might seem ordinary, you'd still glued to the screen just to watch Lee in action.\n\nAnd if it's action you want, then it's action you'll get. Instead of sitting through the stories to glimpse the action, this Code 3 DVD has a &quot;fight&quot; menu for you to zoom in on the action sequences only. It's a pity though that there's no preview or description to describe what you're about to see.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03cbd8d07cc2d2eddea54dca3b295d394f880bc8","amp;dn":"The+Green+Hornet++%2B+Black+Beauty+Docu%281974%29%28Bruce+Lee%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03cbd8d07cc2d2eddea54dca3b295d394f880bc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,203,216,208,124,194,210,237,222,165,77,202,59,41,93,57,79,136,11,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
