However, the test CRCs and copy CRCs all matched when I ripped this.   This is probably a different pressing.\n\n\nFrom Wickipedia:\nNever A Dull Moment is a 1972 album by rock musician Rod Stewart. It became\na UK number-one album (for two weeks) and reached number two on the US Album\nchart the same year. The track, &quot;You Wear It Well&quot;, co-written by Stewart and\nclassical guitarist Martin Quittenton, was a smash hit (another UK No. 1; in\nUSA No. 13), as well as &quot;Twistin' the Night Away&quot;, a song originally recorded\nby Sam Cooke.  Other guest musicians included Ray Jackson of the band Lindisfarne\non mandolin, Spike Heatley on stand-up bass, Gordon Huntley on steel guitar, Dick\nPowell on violin.  &quot;Mama You Been on My Mind&quot; is a cover version of a Bob Dylan \nsong. Stewart's version is one of the songs featured in Nick Hornby's book 31 Songs.\n\n\nCD ripped using EAC.  Log, cue and covers are included.\n\nFor more on flac:\nhttp://xs.vc/eac/index.html\nsourceforge.net\ndbpoweramp.com\nexactaudiocopy.de\n\n\n\nRod Stewart - Never A Dull Moment\n\n01.
