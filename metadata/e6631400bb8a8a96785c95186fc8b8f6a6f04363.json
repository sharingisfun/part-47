Correct issues connecting to and displaying data stores for Exchange 2010\n   2. Change behavior when stopping a defrag pass. PerfectDisk used to display the statistics at the time you stopped even though they were inaccurate. PerfectDisk no longer does this.\n   3. The display files in block feature has been disabled during a defrag and analyze pass since there was no data to display\n   4. Corrected some display issues on the virtual machine tab\n   5. Added support for translation into Japanese\n   6. Corrected some statistical calculations when files are being added and deleted from the drive during the defragmentation pass.\n   7. The list of drive types that can be impersonated was limited to prevent confusion. The purpose of impersonating drive types was due to the inability to accurately determine whether or not a drive is a solid state drive.\n   8. Corrected a display issue on the Hyper-V host product. GUID was being displayed in lieu of the guest computer name.\n   9. Clarified the code to ensure the user realized the schedules maximum duration only applies to the online portion of the schedule. There is not maximum duration for a boot-time defragmentation pass.\n  10. Ensure that PerfectDisk does not attempt to perform an offline defragmentation pass on a FAT/FAT32 from a schedule. This functionality is not supported.\n  11. Corrected some typo's in displayed text\n  12. Changed the default behavior regarding file modification date on FAT/FAT32 drives. When no date exists we now display nothing. We used to display 1980.\n  13. Improved the layout to better fit all the on screen data\n  14. Corrected a bug when defragmenting drives greater than 2,147,483,648 clusters (8 TB with 4k cluster size)\n  15. Improved boot-time defragmentation logging.\n  16. Corrected a display issue with the schedule tab buttons when using Group Policy.\n  17.
