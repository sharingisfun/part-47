The song's power ballad style made it a worldwide hit, and it demonstrated the band's new, more mature sound after their success as a glam metal band in the 80's. Released as a successful single in 1993, it reached #10 on the Billboard Hot 100, #13 in the UK Top 40 and #10 in the German Top 100.\n\nJon Bon Jovi claimed he wrote the song in a hotel room while suffering from a hangover, and the song reflects his feelings at the time. The song contains drawn out guitar riffs and soft piano playing, combined with emotive and powerful vocals by Jon to create a power ballad love song.The line&quot;as I dream about movies they won't make of me when I am dead&quot; is indicative of the central theme of rugged existence interwoven with soaring hopes at the same time.\n\nBed Of Roses became a staple on Bon Jovi setlists for years to come, and was featured on the band's Cross Road greatest hits album, and in acoustic style on This Left Feels Right. A live performance can be viewed on The Crush Tour DVD. A version with lyrics in Spanish was also recorded, entitled &quot;Cama De Rosas&quot;.In 2007 The band Hinder released an acoustic version of the song for an exclusive rerelease of their triple platinum album Extreme Behavior.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9dc914ea5e72164f47ed69e24d51384344685ec","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+Bed+Of+Roses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9dc914ea5e72164f47ed69e24d51384344685ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,220,145,78,165,231,33,100,244,126,214,158,36,213,19,132,52,70,133,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
