The main character - a young girl - going home, where there was four years old. But now it is not there waiting for old records and family photos - she will be a real adult Nepridumannoe tragedy. Life in his native city of the Caucasus has become dangerous. The heroine seeks to leave immediately and take away with her grandparents. But my grandmother did not want to leave, throw home, work at a music school, its pupils. And one character can not leave: no more trains ...\n2) Pick a Moscow native, to take away out of the war - that's what drives Lena, when she comes into the mountains. However, it can not leave: no trains, the threat of air attack becomes more distinct. There is no choice - only to reconcile and stay.\nThe film is dedicated to the Karabakh conflict, but military action is not important. War passes, background and the foreground human actions and inner monologues. Slowness and even mournful tune on a melancholy picture of a contemplative mood. The symbolism of staff, permanent shade give a &quot;lighthouse&quot; epic and, as far as possible, remove him from the present. Instead ostrosotsialnoy drama directing our attention are &quot;reflections on the theme&quot; that do not come into contact with real life. Despite the film used in the documentary chronicles, &quot;Lighthouse&quot; is a thing in itself, a reflection of the inner world of its creators.\n\nAwards:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ prize of &quot;Golden Apricot&quot; Film Festival in Armenia in 2006\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Manufacturer (text information about the trading company &quot;Nikitin&quot; and the film company &quot;Andrew's flag&quot;);\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The creators and performers (text message);\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Photo Gallery Photos from the set (1'18 &quot;)?
