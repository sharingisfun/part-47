But when a series of violent outbreaks by teens sends panic surging through the nation, high school is right where Allie finds herself again. Remolded into what the government calls The Academie, what was once the public school system is now the permanent home of everyone under the age of 22.\n\nAfter a year away at college and a lifetime as a model student, Allie doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take well to The AcademieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s militaristic nature or its 16 foot perimeter fences. Remembering all sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left behind, including the boyfriend sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now years away from seeing again, Allie plummets into depression. But when strange things begin to happen and her brother disappears, Allie realizes she must unravel the mystery that is The AcademieÃ¢â‚¬â€before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98e156aa0d5967b6ba0c5bb7f8e98d9befe4c995","amp;dn":"The+Academie+-+Amy+Joy+LittleFairyRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98e156aa0d5967b6ba0c5bb7f8e98d9befe4c995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,225,86,170,13,89,103,182,186,12,91,183,248,233,141,155,239,228,201,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
