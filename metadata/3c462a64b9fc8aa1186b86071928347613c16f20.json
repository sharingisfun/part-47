The film strikes a graceful balance between abstraction (either found or created) and personal history, with ingenious uses of on- and offscreen sound, and it plays like a portfolio of 60 miniature films, each a suspenseful puzzle and a beautifully composed mechanism. A few years ago Benning returned to his hometown to fashion this shot-for-shot remake (2005), planting his camera in the same places and, whenever possible, using the same people. Though it's not on the same level, it's a poignant and fascinating companion piece. \nBy Jonathan Rosenbaum ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c462a64b9fc8aa1186b86071928347613c16f20","amp;dn":"james+benning.+one+way+boogie+woogie+%26amp%3B+27+years+later.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c462a64b9fc8aa1186b86071928347613c16f20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,70,42,100,185,252,138,161,24,107,134,7,25,40,52,118,19,193,111,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
