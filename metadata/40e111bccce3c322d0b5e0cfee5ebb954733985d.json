Their influence spawned an entire sub-genre within hip hop that eventually fueled the careers of Eminem, Tech N9ne, ICP and Kid Rock.\n\nHomey Don't Play is the first extended play by Esham. Released in 1990, the EP marks the debut of &quot;Homey the Clown&quot;, a persona Smith would later revive for his 2009 EP I Ain't Cha Homey. According to Insane Clown Posse member Joseph Bruce, the EP's cover, which depicted Esham wearing clown paint, inspired the group's use of face paint in their act.\n\n\nENJOY &amp; SEED\n\n \nIf you like Esham, then buy all his wicket shit.
