MxPx members Mike Herrera and Tom Wisniewski joined with Dale Yob (Ninety Pound Wuss and Slick Shoes[1]) and a mutual friend, Jiles O'Neal. They only created one album, entitled Let's Play House, which was released in 1997. The name &quot;Cootees&quot; is an intentional misspelling of the fictitious disease ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ cooties.\n\n1. (Blank)\n2. Shut Up\n3. Mike's Waiting\n4. Roses Are Red\n5.
