An arriving Zanti penal ship with it's hostile cargo on board is set to land in an unpopulated desert area. There the &quot;misfits&quot; will serve their time isolated from human contact. Then things go horribly wrong when two criminals of the human variety (a bank robber and his female accomplice) break into the restricted landing area. Taking this incursion as a threatening breach of their deal, the aliens attack both the bank robbers and later the military headquarters overseeing the operation.  \n\nwww.fatfuckfrank.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c32180770a8fe60991e895800843b53b741d7740","amp;dn":"The+Outer+Limits-+The+Zanti+Misfits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c32180770a8fe60991e895800843b53b741d7740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,33,128,119,10,143,230,9,145,232,149,128,8,67,181,59,116,29,119,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
