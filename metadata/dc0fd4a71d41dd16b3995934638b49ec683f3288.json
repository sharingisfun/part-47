Hegel developed a comprehensive philosophical framework, or &quot;system&quot;, to account in an integrated and developmental way for the relation of mind and nature, the subject and object of knowledge, and psychology, the state, history, art, religion, and philosophy. In particular, he developed a concept of mind or spirit that manifested itself in a set of contradictions and oppositions that it ultimately integrated and united, such as those between nature and freedom, and immanence and transcendence, without eliminating either pole or reducing it to the other. His influential conceptions are of speculative logic or &quot;dialectic,&quot; &quot;absolute idealism,&quot; &quot;Spirit,&quot; negativity, sublation (Aufhebung in German), the &quot;Master/Slave&quot; dialectic, &quot;ethical life,&quot; and the importance of history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc0fd4a71d41dd16b3995934638b49ec683f3288","amp;dn":"Paul+Strathern+-+Hegel+in+90+minutes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc0fd4a71d41dd16b3995934638b49ec683f3288","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,15,212,167,29,65,221,22,179,153,89,52,99,139,73,236,104,63,50,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
