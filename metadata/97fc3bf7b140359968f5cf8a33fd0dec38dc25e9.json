The band's version, a tender ballad with falsetto lead vocal by Brian, was first released on their 1964 album Shut Down Volume 2. It was also released as the B-side of The Beach Boys' first U.S. #1 hit single, &quot;I Get Around&quot;, managing to reach #24 on the US Hot 100 in its own right. The single was released in the United States in May, 1964 through Capitol Records. It was released a month later, in June 1964, in the United Kingdom.\n\nBrian Wilson cited the song as his attempt to capture the essence of his all-time favourite record, &quot;Be My Baby&quot; by the Ronettes, who would later cover his song. At one time, Wilson listened to his 45 record of the song he &quot;could never do&quot; up to 100 times a day.\n\nJohn Lennon's 1980 hit &quot;(Just Like) Starting Over&quot; strongly borrows from the verse melody of &quot;Don't Worry Baby&quot;, while Garbage's 1998 hit Push It contains an interpolation of its chorus.\n\nThe song is prominently featured in the 2006 thriller DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Vu.\n\nThe song &quot;Don't Worry Baby&quot; is part of the The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list.\n\nIt is ranked #176 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of &quot;the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97fc3bf7b140359968f5cf8a33fd0dec38dc25e9","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Boys+-+Don%5C%27t+Worry+Baby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97fc3bf7b140359968f5cf8a33fd0dec38dc25e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,252,59,247,177,64,53,153,104,245,207,138,51,253,13,236,56,220,37,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
