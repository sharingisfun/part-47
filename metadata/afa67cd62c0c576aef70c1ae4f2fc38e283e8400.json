In its current form Fraps performs many tasks and can best be described as:\n\nBenchmarking Software - Show how many Frames Per Second (FPS) you are getting in a corner of your screen. Perform custom benchmarks and measure the frame rate between any two points. Save the statistics out to disk and use them for your own reviews and applications.\n\nScreen Capture Software - Take a screenshot with the press of a key! There's no need to paste into a paint program every time you want a new shot. Your screen captures are automatically named and timestamped.\n\nRealtime Video Capture Software - Have you ever wanted to record video while playing your favourite game? Come join the Machinima revolution! Throw away the VCR, forget about using a DV cam, game recording has never been this easy! Fraps can capture audio and video up to 2560x1600 with custom frame rates from 10 to 100 frames per second!\n\nYouTube Link:\n\nNew features and a new look!\n\nFraps is now compatible with Windows 7 and the latest DirectX 11 games.\n\nVentrilo &amp; TeamSpeak users have long wanted a way to record their microphone and speakers at the same time. For Windows 7 and Vista we've added realtime sound mixing to our video recording so you can now capture both sides of the conversation!\n\nNVIDIA have recently included stereoscopic 3D support directly into their drivers. If you play your DirectX9 (D3D9) game with 3D Vision enabled you can use Fraps to record the game in full 3D too! You'll get a side-by-side stereo AVI recording that you can drop straight in to a stereoscopic 3D player!\n\nChangelog:\n- Fixed crash when starting Fraps for some users\n- Fixed hotkeys not being detected when modifier keys held\n- Fixed keys getting stuck when used by both the game and Fraps\n\nenjoy........andKEEP SEEDING","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afa67cd62c0c576aef70c1ae4f2fc38e283e8400","amp;dn":"Fraps+v3.4.1+Build+13142+Retail%28Fully+Activated%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afa67cd62c0c576aef70c1ae4f2fc38e283e8400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,166,124,214,44,12,87,106,239,112,193,174,79,47,195,142,40,62,132,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
