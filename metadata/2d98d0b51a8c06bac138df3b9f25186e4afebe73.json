When high-flying politician Robert Thorn (Peck) learns that his child has died during birth, he decides to accept an invitation by a cleric to pass another newly-orphaned baby off his own - his wife Katherine (Remick) &quot;need never know.&quot; Five years later and Robert, Katherine and the floppy-haired moppet Damien are all happily settled into a new life in London. But when a bonkers-sounding priest presents him with dire warnings of an imminent Armageddon and people around him start mysteriously dying, Robert comes to realise that Damien may - gasp! - actually be the son of the Devil.\n\nThe Omen withstands the cruel paws of time for several reasons. Firstly - and crucially - is the cast. We don't learn a great deal about Peck's character, yet his wrinkled brow and stoic manner tell us all that we need as we watch his politician's regimented life slowly unravelling. Just as impressive is Remick who, in a difficult role, goes from doting on her son's every word to being utterly terrified of him. And then there's the supporting cast - Billie Whitelaw's measured, unsettling study in creepiness as the boy's nanny; the great David Warner as the shifty-looking photographer who helps uncover the truth about Damien; and, of course, Harvey Stevens as Damien himself who makes for an effectively sinister kid (just look at that fringe).\n\nThe Omen is also marked out by its succession of gory and excellently-choreographed set pieces. If it's been a few years since you last watched The Omen these are the bits that you're likely to remember - death by impaling, death by beheading, death by hanging... each one of them delivered with a gleeful aplomb by director Donner (in the film that made his name).\n\nDespite the gore this is no cheap exploitation film though. No, this is a well-crafted big-budget horror for adults. And from the isolating enormity of the Thorn residence to Jerry Goldsmith's operatic score there is always the sense that this is a movie that everyone involved in has taken great care to get right - a classical picture as involving as the very best Hollywood melodrama.\n\nOkay, so The Omen isn't as terrifying as it may once have been. But with its word-perfect script and attention to detail it's proof that a horror movie can be about much more than cheap shocks. We don't even need to mention the recent entirely pointless remake, right?\n\n\n\nSubtitles: Czech, English, Serbian, Slovenian\nScreenshots\t\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/2019/the...omen001.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/2019/the...omen001.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://img527.imageshack.us/img527/3356/the...omen002.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://img527.imageshack.us/img527/3356/the...omen002.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/8606/the...omen003.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/8606/the...omen003.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://img149.imageshack.us/img149/4153/the...omen004.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://img149.imageshack.us/img149/4153/the...omen004.png&lt;/a&gt;\nIMDb Info \t-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nInformation:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTitle: The Omen\nYear: 1976\nRuntime: 107 min mins\nVotes: 24,129 votes\nRating: 7.6\nAll Genres: Horror, Mystery, Thriller, IMDb Horror section\nTagline: OUR FINAL WARNING.\nDirector: Richard Donner\nWriting By: David Seltzer\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDescription:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n. Robert and Katherine Thorn seem to have it all. He is the US Ambassador to Italy and they want for nothing in their lives, except one thing: they do not have children. When Katharine has a stillborn child, Robert is approached by a priest at the hospital who suggest that he take a healthy newborn whose mother has just died in childbirth. Without telling his wife he agrees to to so but after relocating to London, strange events - and the ominous warnings of a priest - lead him to believe that the child he took from that Italian hospital is evil incarnate. Written by garykmcd\n. Gregory Peck is the ambassador to the United States who's wife has a stillborn child. Without her knowledge, he substitutes another baby as theirs. A few years go by, and then grisly deaths begin to happen. The child's nanny hangs herself and a priest is speared to death in a freak accident. It turns out the child is the son of Satan and can only be killed with the seven daggers of Meggado.
