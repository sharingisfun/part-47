Old enough to wear a toob, old enough for new responsibilities. And maybe old enough to go to school in Nyala-- Amira's one true dream.\nBut life in her peaceful Sudanese village is shattered when the Janjaweed arrive. The terrifying attackers ravage the town and unleash unspeakable horrors. After she loses nearly everything, Amira needs to dig deep within herself to find the strength to make the long journey-- on foot-- to safety at a refugee camp. Her days are tough at the camp, until the gift of a simple red pencil opens her mind-- and all kinds of possibilities.\nNew York Times bestselling and Coretta Scott King Award-winning author Andrea Davis Pinkney's powerful verse and Coretta Scott King Award-winning artist Shane W. Evans's breathtaking illustrations combine to tell an inspiring tale of one girl's triumph against all odds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a863c9134e0365d937e0c971817258c23ef0c0e","amp;dn":"Andrea+Davis+Pinkney+-+The+Red+Pencil+%28retail%29+%28epub%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a863c9134e0365d937e0c971817258c23ef0c0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,134,60,145,52,224,54,93,147,126,12,151,24,23,37,140,35,239,12,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
