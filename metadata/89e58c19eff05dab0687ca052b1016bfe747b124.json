There's the possibility a light coating of snow could accumulate mainly across northern parts of the High Plains, but it doesn't appear the snow will negatively affect travel conditions around the area. Still, you'll want to keep it tuned to Storm Search 7 for the latest on this chance for a little wintry weather just in time for Christmas Eve. By Wednesday afternoon, highs will reach the lower to middle 40s with a northwest to northeast wind blowing at 10 to 20 mph.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89e58c19eff05dab0687ca052b1016bfe747b124","amp;dn":"The+Dave+Ramsey+Show+12-18-08","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89e58c19eff05dab0687ca052b1016bfe747b124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,229,140,25,239,240,93,171,6,135,202,5,43,16,22,191,231,71,177,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
