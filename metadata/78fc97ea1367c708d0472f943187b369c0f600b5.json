For centuries werewolves have had to content themselves with shortened forays of feral change as dictated by the source of their power -- the moon! But all that is about to change as three werewolf friends -- Ted, Jeff, and Stan -- leave Earth and travel to the lunar surface in a quest to become Kings of the Moon! Unfortunately, Moon Patrol captain Maggie Pilgrim has other plans . . . as does the hive of vampires living on the dark side!\n\nWritten by Dave Land, Matt &amp; Shawn Fillbach, with art by Matt &amp; Shawn Fillbach. \n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78fc97ea1367c708d0472f943187b369c0f600b5","amp;dn":"Werewolves+on+the+Moon+-+Versus+Vampires","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78fc97ea1367c708d0472f943187b369c0f600b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,252,151,234,19,103,199,8,208,71,47,148,49,135,179,105,192,246,0,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
