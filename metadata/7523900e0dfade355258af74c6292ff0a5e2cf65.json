Most mods are individually compressed within the main .RAR, although there are a few that come as self-extracting executables (.EXE), depending on how they were released. All mods include their original readmes and all other files. WinRAR recommended to open. Enjoy, Morrowind fans, and don't forget to seed!\n\nLong live The Pirate Bay!\n\n\n\nA smaller batch this time, only 24 mods, but all have been played &amp; tested during my own gameplay. I don't vouch for their compatability if you choose to use them all at once, there may be a few glitches if they use the same resources, but I can vouch for their independent compatability. Some require Morrowind's expansions, Tribunal and Bloodmoon, which I'm sure you can find around TPB if you look hard enough. It will be stated in the readme for the individual mods if they do have expansion requirements.\n\nInstallation is the same as any mods unless otherwise stated\n\n/Morrowind/Data Files/\n\nMods list\nAbot's Where are all the Birds Going? v1.13\nAcheron's Camping Gear v1 &amp; v2\nAlmilia's Daughters 3.2\nARJAN's A Lord's Men v2.02\nPrincess Stomper's Ascadian Rose Cottage\nRacer's Roost v1.1\nBigMod v2.2\nChildren of Morrowind (CoM) v.2.0\nDave Humphrey's Furniture v2.01\nDulsya Isle\nMetallic Signs by dxm\nFliggerty's Armor Project\nPegas' Horse Ranch by Madmax v3.1\nKayla's Knick-Knacks by Qarl\nMarksman Enhanced v1.2\nMorrowind Script Extender (MWSE)\nMorrowind Trading Cards 1.17\nMagical Trinkets of Tamriel IV v.79 patch\nPrincess Stomper's Pocket Homes\nSuran Extended Gold Edition v1.2\nThe Crimson Wire\nVivec marksman's shop v1.1\nBetter Bodies v2.2 by Psychodog Studios\n\nThanks for your interest in Morrowind and it's excellent mods, and a thanks to the MW modding community.\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7523900e0dfade355258af74c6292ff0a5e2cf65","amp;dn":"Morrowind+Mods+II.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7523900e0dfade355258af74c6292ff0a5e2cf65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,35,144,14,13,250,222,53,82,88,175,116,198,41,47,240,165,226,207,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
