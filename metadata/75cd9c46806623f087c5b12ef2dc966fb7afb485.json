Hopefully this one will work. ;-)\n\n########################\n\n\nThis is a mashup of Pink Floyd's Dogs of War and NIN's Good Soldier and Closer. \n\nThe video depicts war. War is gruesome therefore this video is gruesome. I firmly believe that the portrayal of war should not be sanitized. To do so is to create a lie of omission. If we are going to declare war on someone - or a word from the dictionary - we need to know what waging war really means so we can make our best judgments about whether it is truly worth it. \n\nThe purpose of this is not to be a shock vid but to offer multiple view points to the same situation.
