AMMA is a collection of one of every song that was played live during the 2008 Lights Over North/South America Tour. I went through every concert that was taped and found what I thought to be the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ performance of each song and mixed them all together to make it sound like one concert. All tracks are FLAC sourced. Please only convert this to mp3 for personal use out of respect to the tapers that were kind enough to record the concerts and share them with all of us. Even though ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStarfuckersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe CollectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ were played once or twice there arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t any FLAC recordings of them so theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not included in this compilation. An updated version of this may come out if those recordings do surface. Most importantly, thanks to the guys in NIN. This compilation is about the band that toured together for all of 2008, maybe the best incarnation of NIN to date.\n\ngladcarrot asked for the concert sources so I put up my best guess of them. When I download a boot I only save the audio and just label them source 1, 2,3,etc.. as they pop up. So I went back through dime and labled the sources that way. I'm not 100% by any means on this so if anyone thinks I labled a source wrong let me know and I'll fix this list. \n\n&lt;song title&gt; &lt;track length&gt; &lt;date and city&gt; &lt;source&gt; \n\n999,999 0:01:15 2008 08-13 Duluth, GA radiokid311 \n1,000,000 0:04:01 2008 08-25 Toledo, OH gladcarrot \nLetting You 0:03:54 2008 10-21 Monterrey, Mexico migmanson \nDiscipline 0:04:23 2008 12-13 Las Vegas, NV sin213 \nMarch Of The Pigs 0:04:01 2008 11-25 Mineapolis, MN thedevil666 \nPiggy 0:04:55 2008 10-04 Santiago, Chile FaaipDeOaid \nHead Down 0:04:00 2008 12-13 Las Vegas, NV tapeworm \nLa Mer (Intro) 0:00:29 2008 11-03 Greensboro, NC xjsb125 \nThe Frail 0:02:37 2008 11-17 Columbus, OH gladcarrot \nThe Wretched 0:07:08 2008 11-18 Fort Wayne, IN Radiohead8989 \nReptile 0:06:41 2008 08-22 Cleveland, OH Ryan J \nCloser 0:04:25 2008 11-25 Mineapolis, MN thedevil666 \nThe Line Begins To Blur 0:03:45 2008 08-18 Dallas, TX Treeman \nGave Up 0:04:40 2008 11-01 Greenville, SC Hahninator \nCorona Radiata 0:02:20 2008 10-04 Santiago, Chile FaaipDeOaid \nMe, I'm Not 0:05:32 2008 09-02 Morrison, CO brianblank \nThe Warning 0:03:41 2008 10-21 Monterrey, Mexico migmanson \nVessel 0:05:43 2008 10-04 Santiago, Chile FaaipDeOaid \nThe Great Destroyer 0:04:15 2008 10-23 San Antonio, TX aleal5687 \n01 Ghosts I 0:02:57 2008 07-26 Seattle, WA jfb \n25 Ghosts III 0:02:23 2008 07-26 Seattle, WA jfb \n05 Ghosts I 0:03:11 2008 11-25 Mineapolis, MN thedevil666 \n06 Ghosts I 0:04:45 2008 09-02 Morrison, CO brianblank \n17 Ghosts II 0:02:27 2008 11-18 Fort Wayne, IN gladcarrot \n28 Ghosts IV 0:05:05 2008 12-13 Las Vegas, NV tapeworm \n21 Ghosts III 0:02:47 2008 11-08 Manchester, NH BennyBlanco \n14 Ghosts II 0:03:25 2008 11-18 Fort Wayne, IN gladcarrot \n10 Ghosts II 0:02:18 2008 11-03 Greensboro, NC xjsb125 \n32 Ghosts IV 0:04:32 2008 08-12 Knoxville, TN xjsb125 \n19 Ghosts III 0:02:41 2008 09-02 Morrison, CO brianblank \nPiggy (Ghosts Version) 0:06:00 2008 11-18 Fort Wayne, IN gladcarrot \nThe Greater Good 0:04:36 2008 11-09 Worcester, MA BennyBlanco \nPinion 0:00:35 2008 11-08 Manchester, NH BennyBlanco \nWish 0:03:38 2008 08-20 St. Louis, MO nihilistic0 \nTerrible Lie 0:05:02 2008 08-20 St. Louis, MO nihilistic0 \nSurvivalism 0:04:40 2008 10-04 Santiago, Chile FaaipDeOaid \nThe Big Come Down 0:04:05 2008 12-13 Las Vegas, NV tapeworm \n31 Ghosts IV 0:02:30 2008 10-21 Monterrey, Mexico migmanson \nOnly 0:05:22 2008 08-22 Cleveland, OH Ryan J \nDown In It 0:04:31 2008 09-02 Morrison, CO brianblank \nThe Hand That Feeds 0:03:29 2008 11-15 Grand Rapids, MI Ryan J \nHead Like A Hole 0:04:41 2008 11-09 Worcester, MA BennyBlanco \nEncore Break 0:03:18 2008 11-09 Worcester, MA BennyBlanco \nEchoplex 0:05:41 2008 08-23 Auburn Hills, MI Ryan J \nLove Is Not Enough 0:03:50 2008 08-20 St. Louis, MO nihilistic0 \nTrent Speaks 0:03:40 2008 12-13 Las Vegas, NV tapeworm \nThe Beginning of the End 0:03:00 2008 11-15 Grand Rapids, MI Ryan J \n08 Ghosts I 0:03:09 2008 08-29 Philadelphia, PA Dassarri \nGetting Smaller 0:04:15 2008 08-18 Dallas, TX Treeman \nReptile (w/ Peter Murphy) 0:07:02 2008 11-09 Worcester, MA BennyBlanco \nMeet Your Master 0:04:25 2008 08-25 Toledo, OH Ryan J \nGod Given 0:03:53 2008 09-02 Morrison, CO brianblank \nThe Good Soldier 0:03:49 2008 10-23 San Antonio, TX aleal5687 \nHurt 0:04:50 2008 08-13 Duluth, GA radiokid312 \nIn This Twilight 0:05:53 2008 10-23 San Antonio, TX aleal5687\n\nTotal Time is 3 hours and 40 minutes.\nThere are 2 versions of the artwork because I couldn't choose.\ndiscussion here: http://www.echoingthesound.org/phpbbx/viewtopic.php?t=46136&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0\n~mike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc01f960291521a03a2777d9cc5b08afc35b0b99","amp;dn":"nine+inch+nails%3A+a+million+miles+away+%28live+2008%29+Apple+Lossless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc01f960291521a03a2777d9cc5b08afc35b0b99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,1,249,96,41,21,33,160,58,39,119,217,204,91,8,175,195,91,11,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
