Mok - Cathy Dennis' debut, Move to This, is one of those head-scratching anomalies in pop-music history. Ever since the market became albums-driven, four Top 10 singles from one album would usually get the album at least a platinum record. Instead, the singles from Move to This were all over the airwaves in 1990 and 1991, but the record itself barely dented the charts. The album climbed as high as the 50s on Billboard's Albums chart, I think, and a search of the RIAA's database yields no records of gold or platinum awards. To this day, people remember songs like &quot;Touch Me (All Night Long)&quot;, &quot;Just Another Dream&quot; and &quot;Too Many Walls&quot;, but the album languishes in the out-of-print wasteland. Perhaps it was Dennis' slightly kitschy Louise Brooks haircut, or the cheesy colour scheme of the album cover. \n\nIt's a shame, because Move to This was just an excellent dance/pop record. D-Mob's &quot;C'mon and Get My Love&quot; (rightly included here), with lead vocals by Dennis, already heralded a dance vocalist of remarkable confidence, and &quot;Just Another Dream&quot; was one of those singles that grabbed your ear with a few notes. And &quot;Too Many Walls&quot; remains a radio staple today, with its spritely beat, memorable melodies, and Dennis' knowingly innocent lead vocal making for a perfect pop ballad. The moody Europop of &quot;Tell Me&quot; and the pulsating club beat of the title track are also highlights. On a musical front, the only drawback is that the uptempo dance songs sound a little similar arrangement-wise, with the heavy club beats and '80s-pop keyboards permeating all the tracks. However, they are certainly no more repetitive than any other club-style dance record, and Dennis' singing is just superlative. So now, almost 15 years after this record was released, I remain baffled as to why it's more a cult hit than the evergreen hits trove it really is.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Just Another Dream\n[02] Touch Me (All Night Long)\n[03] CÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢mon &amp; Get My Love\n[04] Too Many Walls\n[05] Tell Me\n[06] Everybody Move\n[07] Move To This\n[08] My Beating Heart\n[09] Got To Get Your Love\n[10] Taste My Love\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:41m:15s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 105mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200 dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop Dance\nRelease Date\t&gt; 29 July 1990\nRecord Company\t&gt; Polydor\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Dennis \n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/cathydennis \n&gt;[Just Another Dream]\n&gt;[CÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢mon &amp; Get My Love]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14345452a035370866c0f8a1a79fa7e2180d889e","amp;dn":"%5B1990%5D+Move+To+This+-+Cathy+Denis+105mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14345452a035370866c0f8a1a79fa7e2180d889e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,52,84,82,160,53,55,8,102,192,248,161,167,159,167,226,24,13,136,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
