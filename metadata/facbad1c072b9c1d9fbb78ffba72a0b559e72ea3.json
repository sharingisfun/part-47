No one travelling along the key points in the area can remain unaffected. It is not possible to stay aside from the feelings that the Fragments of Live History awaken in the human being. A landscape can captivate, yet the emotional load, in all its aspects and degrees, from light to darkness, impregnates whoever visits such south-eastern areas in Asia.\n\nWith respect to Michel Huygen, there is no doubt that the experience must have somehow impressed him in a special way, activating in him the creative springs and maybe establishing in his artistic biography a ?Before? and an ?Afterwards?.\n\nThese experiences have presented to him within a brief yet intense period of his life, when the death of a person who was very close to him has taken him to this unknown ocean that opens at the end of life, very much like such events have always taken us near to it.\n\nTherefore it is not strange that such experiences have moved him to reflect the feelings, the hope, the sense of transcendentalism and the ?magic? that these special places he has visited must have generated in him, as well as his personal career especially at this stage of his life, in the form of music.\n\nThe first release of this peculiar musical trek is the CD &quot;ANGKOR&quot;, which, as suggested by its title, has been inspired by the impressive temple of Angkor Wat, a millenial cultural crossroads.\n\n\nMore information, here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.neuronium.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.neuronium.com&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animamusic.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animamusic.net&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:facbad1c072b9c1d9fbb78ffba72a0b559e72ea3","amp;dn":"Michel+Huygen++-+Angkor.+Extreme+Meditation+Vol1+-+Newage+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"facbad1c072b9c1d9fbb78ffba72a0b559e72ea3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,203,173,28,7,43,156,29,159,187,120,255,186,114,160,181,89,231,46,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
