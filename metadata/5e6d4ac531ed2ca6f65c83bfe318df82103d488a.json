Turns out this was nothing but a bullshit lie and thus his aliby to edit posts at the forum. Tauro cut a deal with File Factory and majority downloads are text files that link directly to File Factory. Members are FORCED to reply to gain access to porn. The File Factory account was created by Tauro under VDF. Don&amp;#039;t make one man filthy rich by profiting off his own members bandwidth who post porn there. Simply put, &quot;it&amp;#039;s a low down dirty shame&quot;\t\n\nAll my PB torrent shares:\n                                       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Shoey1964&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Shoey1964&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e6d4ac531ed2ca6f65c83bfe318df82103d488a","amp;dn":"%5BNEW%5D+%7E+Deauxma+-+DoctorAdventures+%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e6d4ac531ed2ca6f65c83bfe318df82103d488a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,109,74,197,49,237,44,166,246,92,131,191,227,24,223,130,16,61,72,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
