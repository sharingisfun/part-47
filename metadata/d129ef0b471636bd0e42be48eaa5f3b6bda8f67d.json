Blues Got A Hold On Me\n\n\nBorn into a show business family, Nelsen was already a professional musician at 15. A true &quot;Blues Journeyman&quot; Nelsen earned his stripes playing tough, gritty joints and taverns of the East Coast Blues Circuit. He shared the stage with such greats as Muddy Waters, James Cotton, Matt &quot;Guitar&quot; Murphy and Johnny Winter. Inspired by these legends, Nelsen developed a melodic driving style on both guitar and harmonics. A world class blues vocalist, Nelsen's voice is truly an expressive instrument. Striking the right balance of torment, and tenderness so essential to this style.\n\nHis new album is a send up to the Louisiana style of Blues that has influenced Nelsen throughout his career. &quot;Take Me Back&quot; is a true showcase of Nelsen's vocal ability as well as showing off his songwriting skills, and his proficiency on guitar, harp and piano. His latest album is definitely his best!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d129ef0b471636bd0e42be48eaa5f3b6bda8f67d","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Nelsen+Adelard+-+Take+Me+Back","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d129ef0b471636bd0e42be48eaa5f3b6bda8f67d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,41,239,11,71,22,54,189,14,66,190,72,234,165,243,182,189,168,246,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
