Randle \n \n\n\nInvestigator and author Kevin Randle discussed UFO reports from around the world and throughout the ages, including Roswell, Kecksburg, and Shag Harbour. In 1950, Frank Scully published the book Behind the Flying Saucers that first brought attention to purported UFO crashes in such places as Aztec, NM, and Paradise Valley, AZ. But a reporter for True Magazine in 1952 so thoroughly debunked UFO crashes in the public's mind that investigators ignored such cases for quite a few years afterward, Randle noted. One of the earliest UFO cases he researched was an account from 840 AD in France in which a mob was about to stone a group of people, who were said to come down from &quot;cloud ships.&quot; \n\nIn one newspaper account, witnesses who were shipwrecked in the Indian Ocean in 1862, described seeing an object crash into a cliff. They went to the site and saw giant-sized corpses, though Randle suspects this could have been a tall tale. Other newspaper accounts described a UFO crash that occurred in Nebraska in the 1880's. The wreckage was too hot to get near, but tiny ears were reportedly found. \n\nInterestingly, Randle said he was not able to find any newspaper reportage for the Aurora, Texas UFO crash of 1897 in which an alien was allegedly buried at a cemetery, and so he believes this crash was probably a hoax. Predating Roswell by six years, was an incident in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, originally investigated by Len Stringfield. It involved a Reverend who was summoned to pray over the bodies of three alien crash victims. Randle also talked about his investigations into the Roswell case, and his interviews with various players such as Glenn Dennis, Frank Kaufmann, and Walter Haut. \n\n\nWebsite(s):\nBook(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Crash: When UFOs Fall From the Sky\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Operation Roswell\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Signals: The Exploration Chronicles, Book 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc81c293877e8c2068c693a685a4f3afeb5c0a2b","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+06-01-10+-+UFO+Crashes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc81c293877e8c2068c693a685a4f3afeb5c0a2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,129,194,147,135,126,140,32,104,198,147,166,133,164,243,175,235,92,10,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
