Montgomery is cast as a secret service agent Tom Horn, sent West to round up a gang of counterfeiters. He starts by gaining the confidence of dance-hall girl Lil (Windsor), one of the ringleaders. She, in turn, leads Horn to the brains of the operation, Harve Logan\n(Cameron). When Lil finds out that Horn is a Fed, she's tempted to fill him full of holes; instead, having fallen in love with him, she tries to help him get the goods on Logan. Dakota Lil was based on a story by Frank Gruber, later one of the leading lights of the TV-western craze.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042370/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042370/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMovie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:24:01\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480 4/3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1036 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,14 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc1eb3c955f798e46e66d864c3103cbcfec9cd55","amp;dn":"Dakota+Lil+%281950%29+George+Montgomery+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc1eb3c955f798e46e66d864c3103cbcfec9cd55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,30,179,201,85,247,152,228,110,102,216,100,195,16,60,188,254,201,205,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
