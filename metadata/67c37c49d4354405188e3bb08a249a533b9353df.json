Some of the predictions made in the show came true, such as phones in cars. Nicely non-PC with a dark mood to it, most of the episodes do not end on a happy note.\n\nThis is the last set of episodes of this series, only 26 were ever made.\n\nTech Info\n=========\n\nVideo Track #1:\nFOURCC: &quot;XVID&quot; (XviD Mpeg-4 Video)\n512x384, 25,000000 fps\n\nAudio Track #1:\nFormatTag : &quot;85&quot; (MPEG-1 Layer-3 Audio (mp3))\n2 channels, 48000Hz\nLanguage: N/A\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67c37c49d4354405188e3bb08a249a533b9353df","amp;dn":"UFO+-+Episodes+21+to+26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67c37c49d4354405188e3bb08a249a533b9353df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,195,124,73,212,53,68,5,24,142,59,176,138,36,154,83,59,147,83,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
