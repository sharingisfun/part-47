The show aired three seasons - 2004, 2007, and 2008.\n\nThe title refers to the host of the show, Canadian filmmaker and survival expert Les Stroud, who must use his skills to survive for seven days alone in remote locales with little or no food, water, and equipment.\n\nDuring the filming of each episode, Stroud is alone, and operates all the cameras himself. He is equipped with only his clothes, camera equipment (which he does not use for survival except in an emergency), his harmonica, a Leatherman multi-tool, and often &quot;everyday items&quot; relevant to the episode's particular survival scenario. For safety purposes, Stroud carries an emergency satellite phone. However, Stroud has claimed that while filming several episodes, there were times when his emergency phone did not work, leaving him totally alone. On a few occasions, Stroud has also been provided with a rifle.\n\nSurvivorman can be considered a sequel or spin-off to Stroud's earlier project, Stranded, a five-part series that was shown on the Canadian Discovery Channel in 2001.\n\nLes Stroud stopped filming Survivorman after the third season due to what he described as the significant physical toll of filming each episode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e946e3dd3ce98807a6c833ebe9040222a485c015","amp;dn":"Survivorman+Season+02++--+%40+%7BMW%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e946e3dd3ce98807a6c833ebe9040222a485c015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,70,227,221,60,233,136,7,166,200,51,235,233,4,2,34,164,133,192,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
