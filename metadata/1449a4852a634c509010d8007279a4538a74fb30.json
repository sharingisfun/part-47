In the tenth instalment of Charlaine Harris's resilient Southern Vampire series, Sookie and heartthrob Eric Northman come under intense regal scrutiny, but there are dangers even closer at hand: The doors to Faery slammed shut before some Fae were able to return and they're holding Sookie very personally responsible. (Hand-selling tip: HBO's True Blood is based on this series. The third season of this Emmy and Golden Globe Award-winning drama begins next month.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1449a4852a634c509010d8007279a4538a74fb30","amp;dn":"Dead+in+the+Family+-+Charlaine+Harris-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1449a4852a634c509010d8007279a4538a74fb30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,73,164,133,42,99,76,80,144,16,216,0,114,121,164,83,138,116,251,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
