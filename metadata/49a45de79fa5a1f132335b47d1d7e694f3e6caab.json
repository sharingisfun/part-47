Anyone reading this, whatever side they come down on, has surely heard arguments both pro and con about the United States. Jingoistic flag wavers think G-d loves us best no matter what, and the Noam Chomsky School for the advanced study of why America sucks can never stop listing our ills.\n\nWell, we take a lot of crap for stuff we didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do (A Turkish official recently blamed American Movies for the spate of jailbreaks in his nation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it apparently never occurred to Turkish prisoners to want to get out prison before Hollywood butted in), and we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get a lot of credit for some rather spiffy things we DO achieve. This book by Dinesh DÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Souza simply takes the time to catalog and define a number of ways in which America fucking ROCKS, thank you very much, and even the haters have to give up some props on that score. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve upped this torrent once before, but few people bothered with it at that time. With the decent publicity my FCL campaign has been getting, I think this second attempt will acquire and maintain enough seeders.\n\n\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s So Great About America?\nDinesh DÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Souza 2003 Unabridged 32kbps\n\nDinesh D'Souza (born April 25, 1961 in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India) is an author and public speaker who once served as the Robert and Karen Rishwain Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.[1]\nD'Souza is the author of numerous New York Times best selling books and a conservative writer and speaker. D'Souza is a Roman Catholic.[2]\nMulticulturalism and the Greatness of America\nD'Souza's book What's So Great About America? (ISBN 0-142-00301-8) (Penguin, 2003), defends his adopted country against the criticisms that have been directed at it in the last couple of decades. In particular, he argues against the criticisms leveled by the Islamic world, domestic multiculturalists, those seeking slavery reparations, and especially America's left wing. Instead, he contends, Americans themselves are too critical and take for granted the blessings bestowed on them by living within the borders of the United States.[14]\nHe also takes this a step further and challenges the notion that all world cultures are equal. &quot;If one begins with the multicultural premise that all cultures are equal, then the world as it is makes very little sense,&quot; he says. &quot;Some cultures have completely outperformed others in providing the things that all people seek -- health, food, housing, security and the amenities of life.&quot;[14]\n--------------\n\nThe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFCLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Series ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ For some length of time now, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve given some thought to putting out something like this. A principal problem is that of labels, and another is the lack of room in a torrent description to write anything approaching even a SYNOPSIS of a clear manifesto. Therefore, I have decided to call this FCL (an acronym for Fiscal Conservative Libertarian) for the sake of brevity and clarity.\n\nThere are in America (and to a lesser degree in Europe) a huge number of people who would largely fit into this camp. We are the practical, the scientific, the skeptical and the truly logically analytical. We are IN NO WAY dogmatic or organized, but we generically agree to a certain extent on some core ideas. We think people who attend rallies or protests are shmucks. We think people can express their political opinions on bumperstickers are too stupid to vote. We think whenever we hear the phrase ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthere ought to be a law!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that there probably shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be. We have differing opinions on abortion, gun control, the death penalty, flag burning, and gay rights, but agree categorically that such decisions ought not to be Constitutional issues and are best left to the local voters. We think that the Federal Government ought not to do much of anything other than core responsibilities, especially if they have no idea how to pay for it. We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t vote with out hearts but with our heads. We are never loyal to any party. We are very pro-military, and most of us have served. We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t trust any politician and we despise empty symbolism, ignorant populism, and idiotic sloganeering. We are all about practical economics, actual freedom from the leftist nannies and rightist religious police, and we like individual responsibility.\n\nPeople like me have been going nuts for a long time with the economic stupidities of our government and fellow citizens, the general inability of these to understand real long term effects, and we are sick to death of people blaming US for George Bush instead of the RELIGIOUS and SOCIAL conservatives who elected him. We are NOT ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œneo-consÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdittoheadsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, or lovers of Fox News, and we are sick and tired of lefties telling us we must be supporters of Limbaugh and Falwell. WE are the people who watch Penn &amp; TellerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s BULLSHIT and love SOUTH PARK. We think Obama is a very nice fellow whose economic policies at best will lead America on a path in the long run to a low rent failed soft-core Socialism. Finally, we think that the 40% on either side that make up the core of the two major sides are usually reaching bad conclusions and voting stupidly because they listen to propaganda and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t truly understand some complicated issues with an honest degree of depth.\n\nTherefore, since there is no shortage of people here with an agenda (some of which borders on the insane), I am going to put out a collection of material that gives a good accounting of the fiscal conservative point of view. Some of it I personally take as gospel, some of it is merely generic. Speaking as a history and social studies teacher, I feel qualified to select materials that reflect this point of view. It is my hope that many will increase their knowledge of complicated historical and economic events by this effort. I do not seek to foster argument or win converts, but merely to explain to the right wingers why we would rather have freedom than ban abortion or marijuana, and to get it through to the left that not everyone who doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t toe their fantasy line is a flat-Earther or fascist. Most of this material will be conservative, and most will deal with economics. There will be no political diatribes from dogmatic and non-practical people (Sorry to all the Coulter and Chomsky fans) who are more intent on pushing a fantasy utopia than pursuing practical liberty.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a45de79fa5a1f132335b47d1d7e694f3e6caab","amp;dn":"FCL+Series+-++Dinesh+D%5C%27Souza+-+What%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2s+So+Great+About+Americ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49a45de79fa5a1f132335b47d1d7e694f3e6caab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,164,93,231,159,165,161,241,50,51,91,71,209,215,230,148,243,230,202,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
