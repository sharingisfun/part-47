Set in New York State, the story centres on juvenile murderer, Eric Poole, who at 18 is released from jail having served his sentence for the murder of a young girl. Russell Crowe play the hard-bitten detective who put him away and who is sure Poole is a potential serial killer who will reoffend. He makes it his mission to keep Poole under surveillance as he sets off on a seemingly innocent road trip up-state. But all is not as it seems as Poole soon finds himself on the run with a young girl who has become obsessed with him. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494864/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494864/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb09c2a6ffcaacdcbb88f2a2bd9eaa6b656be6b3","amp;dn":"Tenderness.2009.1080P.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb09c2a6ffcaacdcbb88f2a2bd9eaa6b656be6b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,9,194,166,255,202,172,220,187,136,242,162,189,158,170,107,101,107,230,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
