Info about symbols (places, objects, activities) can be registered in tables and further documented through hyperlinks to pictures, text etc.\n\nFor more information: http://www.ninoxgeo.com/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d8f2cda67e0036e1da01913b7297e45e4d52c1c","amp;dn":"Ninox+Mapper+Lte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d8f2cda67e0036e1da01913b7297e45e4d52c1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,143,44,218,103,224,3,110,29,160,25,19,183,41,126,69,228,213,44,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
