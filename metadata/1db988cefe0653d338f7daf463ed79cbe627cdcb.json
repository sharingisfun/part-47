The story begins as a police detective, \n although devoted to his wife and young son, has entered \n into an affair with a society girl, also married, and   \n while they are parked out in the boonies on a lonely    \n road, they witness a murder. The detective, because of  \n the circumstances of being where he is for the reason   \n he is there, does not attempt to catch the killer and   \n does not report the crime. He is later assigned the     \n case and soon realizes that an innocent man is about to \n take the blame, and the only way he can clear him is to \n arrest the killer and become a witness against him. The \n story-teller also has a vested interest in the old      \n case.                                                   \n                                                         \n\n\n\n\n  C A S T  \n\n\n                                                         \n                                                         \n            William Gargan ...
