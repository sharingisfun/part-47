The game can be\nplayed in singleplayer mode against computer game bots or in multiplayer mode\nagainst players on the Internet or in a Local Area Network. It is also a\npopular platform for mod developers, with a large number of released\nmodifications that alter the gameplay and theme.\n\nIn-game, players assume the role of one of five classes of infantry: Scout,\nAssault, Anti-Tank, Medic, and Engineer. Players also have the ability to fly\nvarious World War II fighter aircraft and bombers, navigate capital ships,\nsubmarines and aircraft carriers, man coastal artillery defenses, drive tanks,\nAPCs and jeeps, and take control of anti-aircraft guns and mounted machine guns.\n\nEach battle takes place on one of several maps located in a variety of places\nand famous battlefields in all of the major theaters of World War II: the\nPacific, European, North African, and Eastern Fronts. Combat is always fought\nbetween the Axis Powers and the Allies. The location determines which\nnation-specific armies are used (for example, on the Wake Island map, it is\nJapan versus the United States, while on the Battle of Britain map, it is\nGermany versus the United Kingdom). The maps in Battlefield 1942 are based on\nreal battles and are somewhat realistically portrayed.\n\nQuote from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_1942\n\n\n\n\n===============================================================================\n\n Speed up Hamachi: http://www.stebie.com/hamachi.htm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d12f3997e2fc29b956bb847e79e4847b935a00b","amp;dn":"Battlefield+1942+Mini+Image+MadMax+Pero","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d12f3997e2fc29b956bb847e79e4847b935a00b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,18,243,153,126,47,194,155,149,107,184,71,231,158,72,71,185,53,160,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
