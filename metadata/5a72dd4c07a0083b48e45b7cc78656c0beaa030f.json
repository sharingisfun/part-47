But Lefty Dizz never had full solo album in U.S. In 1993, he was on tour in Buenos Aires, and gave to Adrian Flores self produced tape, recorded in December 1992, from unknow session in Chicago. Those two sessions are on this album. This is pure Chicago blues.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a72dd4c07a0083b48e45b7cc78656c0beaa030f","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Carlos+Johnson+%26+Lefty+Dizz+-+The+Healer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a72dd4c07a0083b48e45b7cc78656c0beaa030f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,114,221,76,7,160,8,59,72,228,91,124,199,134,86,192,190,170,3,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
