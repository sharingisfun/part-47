The quake triggered a 10-meter-high tsunami along Japan's northern coastline and nations and island states throughout the Pacific Ocean basin are on alert for rising sea waters as the tsunami travels out from the epicenter. Police and local officials report at least 200 people were initially killed, but the death toll is expected to rise significantly.\n\n\n- Walkouts, Bank Boycotts and Recalls: Wisconsin Protests Intensify As Union-Busting Legislation Pushed Through State Assembly\n\nDemocracy Now! reports from the streets of Madison, as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker prepares to sign legislation that will strip away the collective bargaining rights of most public employees. On Thursday, more than 1,000 Madison students walked out of classes; firefighters called for a boycott of a bank with ties to Walker; and the AFL-CIO pushed for the recall of Republican senators. More than 100,000 people are expected to fill the streets of Madison on Saturday.\n\n\n- Mother of 9/11 Victim Condemns King Hearing on Muslim &quot;Radicalization&quot;\n\nNew York Republican Congressman Peter King-chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security-held a controversial yesterday on what he calls the &quot;radicalization&quot; of the American Muslim community. Critics call the hearings a modern-day form of McCarthyism. We speak to Talat Hamdani, the mother of Mohammed Salman Hamdani, who died in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Minnesota Democrat Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, broke down in tears at the hearing when telling the story of her son. We also speak with Mark Potok, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2874bbb012b8220340e58636a00521e6f12dd71e","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+11+mar+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2874bbb012b8220340e58636a00521e6f12dd71e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,116,187,176,18,184,34,3,64,229,134,54,160,5,33,230,241,45,215,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
