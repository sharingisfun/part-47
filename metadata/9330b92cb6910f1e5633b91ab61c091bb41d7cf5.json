Michael Portillo reports for This World on why\n\nit has proved impossible for him to keep his promise.\n\n\n\nOver the past eight months, Portillo's visited the prison camps, and travelled\n\nto Yemen, Bermuda and Washington to investigate what could be done with the 240\n\nremaining prisoners - some of whom are thought to be too dangerous to release,\n\nbut impossible to successfully convict.\n\n\n\nAs a former Defence Secretary, Portillo has first-hand experience of the\n\npolitical conflict between security and civil liberties. He looks at how the\n\nPresident has got stuck between a rock and a hard place. What way forward can\n\nPortillo see for Obama?\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/8421314.stm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/8421314.stm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOther shunster posts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9330b92cb6910f1e5633b91ab61c091bb41d7cf5","amp;dn":"This+World+-+Closing+Guantanamo+2010+01+03+BBC2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9330b92cb6910f1e5633b91ab61c091bb41d7cf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,48,185,44,182,145,15,30,86,51,185,26,182,28,9,27,180,29,124,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
