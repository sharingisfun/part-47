The current lineup consists of Thurston Moore (vocals and guitar), Kim Gordon (vocals, bass, guitar), Lee Ranaldo (vocals and guitar), Mark Ibold (bass) and Steve Shelley (drums).\n\nIn their early career, Sonic Youth was associated with the No Wave art and music scene in New York City. Part of the first wave of American noise rock groups, the band carried out their interpretation of the hardcore punk ethos throughout the evolving American underground that focused more on the DIY ethic of the genre rather than its specific sound. As a result, Sonic Youth was pivotal in the rise of the alternative rock movement.\n\nSonic Youth have expressed a wide variety of influences, ranging from the influential protopunk musician Patti Smith to composer John Cage. The band has been praised for having &quot;redefined what rock guitar could do&quot;, using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings, and preparing guitars with objects like drumsticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments' timbre.\n\nSacred Trickster\nAnti - Orgasm\nLeaky Lifeboat\nAntenna\nWhat We Know\nCalming The Snake\nPoison Arrow\nMalibu Gas Station\nThunderclap for Bobby Pyn\nNo Way\nWalkin Blue\nMassage The History","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82aebe7e813e7d340b868ebb1efa3a667fee0804","amp;dn":"Sonic+Youth+-+The+Eternal+%5BCD+Rip+192k%5D%5BAll+Cov+%2B+CD%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82aebe7e813e7d340b868ebb1efa3a667fee0804","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,174,190,126,129,62,125,52,11,134,142,187,30,250,58,102,127,238,8,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
