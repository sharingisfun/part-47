It was built on 21 March 2009 at around 11:30pm on a MacBook4,1 from the SVN Source tree, so it's the most current as of that date.\n\nThis is far from even being a beta, so expect bugs.\n\nsee http://www.chromium.org/ for more info.\n\nThis is packaged as a single DMG\n\n--- Edit ---\n\nApparently some people are having trouble downloading this torrent. The problem appears that it can't connect to the tracker to find peers. If this happens, there's at least one tracker in the list that (I know) works. I've gotten successful announces and scrapes from http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce, and http://tracker.torrentfr.org:56666/announce. If you can't download for this reason, either try re-adding the torrent, or waiting for your torrent client to pick up on one of the successful trackers. (Or choose a tracker manually, if you can do this) Hope this helps.\n\nThanks for downloading, and help the google chromium project out!\n\nAlso, please note that I'm not affiliated with the project in any way, I just built the code I pulled from SVN one night.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dbcf5f213751a7a789e695b284518ac8859c306","amp;dn":"Google+Chromium+%28Google+Chrome%29+%28Mac%29+%28Intel+Only%29+Built+2009-03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dbcf5f213751a7a789e695b284518ac8859c306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,188,245,242,19,117,26,122,120,158,105,91,40,69,24,172,136,89,195,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
