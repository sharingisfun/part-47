Those hits included &quot;A World Without Love&quot; (U.S. #1), &quot;Nobody I Know&quot;, &quot;I Don't Want To See You Again&quot;, and &quot;Woman&quot;. &quot;Woman&quot; is credited to &quot;Bernard Webb&quot;; McCartney used this pseudonym to see if he could have a hit song even without his famous name attached to it. The song reached number 14 in the US and number 28 on the British charts. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Gordon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Gordon&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOriginal Hits - Peter &amp; Gordon\nDisky 1995\n\n01  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - True Love Ways\n02  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - A World Without Love\n03  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - To Know you Is To Love You\n04  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - I Go To Pieces \n05  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - Lady Godiva\n06  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - Nobody I Know\n07  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - Baby I'm Yours\n08  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - Woman\n09  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - I Don't Want To See You Again\n10  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - Don't Pity Me\n11  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - There's No Living Without Your Loving\n12  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - To Show I Love You\n13  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - Knight In Rusty Armour\n14  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - Sunday For Tea\n15  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - The Jokers\n16  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - Let It Be Me\n17  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - High Noon (Do Not For Sake Me)\n18  Peter &amp; Gordon - Original Hits - Exodus Song\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:apfixqt0ldhe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:apfixqt0ldhe&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10ea6d3e65f5676323a28b8755660e62aeb63b81","amp;dn":"Peter+%26+Gordon+-+Original+Hits+%5B1995%5D++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10ea6d3e65f5676323a28b8755660e62aeb63b81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,234,109,62,101,245,103,99,35,162,139,135,85,102,14,98,174,182,59,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
