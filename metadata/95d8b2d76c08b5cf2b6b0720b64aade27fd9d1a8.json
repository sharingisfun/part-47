Proponents of the theory suggest that there are no isolated islands in the universe. All objects in space, from subatomic particles to galactic clusters, are connected by manifestations of the electric force acting in realtime. \n\nThunderbolts of the Gods by David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill introduces the reader to an age of planetary instability and earthshaking electrical events in ancient times. The 108-page full-color monograph, based on the life work of the two authors, offers a revolutionary synthesis of historical investigation and the newly-discovered &quot;Electric Universe.&quot;\n\nTalbott and Thornhill claim that cosmic upheaval occurred so recently as to have profoundly affected early human cultures, provoking &quot;incomprehensible&quot; myths, symbols, and commemorative practices. Through a synthesis of ancient testimony, high-energy plasma experiments, and space age discoveries, the authors bring the ancient world to life. If their hypothesis is correct, it could not fail to alter many paths of scientific investigation as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nProduced by: Dave Talbott &amp; Ben Ged Low \n---------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTitle: Thunderbolts From The Gods\nYear:  2008\nFile Size: 510 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 01:03:47\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 352x256\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1119 kbit/s\nFPS:  29.970000\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (N/A)\n \n \n\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\t\t\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95d8b2d76c08b5cf2b6b0720b64aade27fd9d1a8","amp;dn":"Thunderbolts+Of+The+Gods-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95d8b2d76c08b5cf2b6b0720b64aade27fd9d1a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,216,178,215,108,8,181,207,43,107,7,32,182,74,173,226,127,217,209,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
