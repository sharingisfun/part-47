This installation also\n includes the recently released hotfix from 17th December (KB960714).\n\n This time, windows is as stripped as possible but it does also include:\n\n Internet Explorer 7\n Windows Media Player 11\n DirectX Updated (including d3dx9_40.dll)\n Microsoft Update\n\n This is a Christmas gift! A fully updated TinyXP for 2008.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n To install Windows TinyXP from this CD, set your PC \n up so it will boot from the CD-ROM in the PC's BIOS.\n\n Once you have booted from the CD, option 1 is the only option you can\n choose to install Windows XP. This option includes added driverpacks,\n but if you are there when Windows is installing, after copying files\n and rebooting for the first time, you will see a command window pop\n up, you have a 15 second timer, if you press ESC in that time, the\n pack currently shown on the screen will not extract, this way, you\n have the option to extract those driverpacks by pressing a numbered\n key within the 15 seconds - or not extracting the driverpacks, by\n pressing ESC.\n\n If you just leave the installation alone completely, all the driverpacks\n will extract, by default.\n\n You cannot install TinyXP as an &quot;upgrade&quot; from within Windows.\n\n Only install TinyXP onto a freshly formatted partition or hard disk.\n There is no upgrade option available in TinyXP,  because the option\n is removed. You do not need any product key in this release - the\n installation of TinyXP is unattended, once you choose the drive or \n partition on which to install TinyXP.\n\n Installation is set to &quot;US English&quot;.\n\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n When you boot from this CD you have six options:\n\n 1) Install TinyXP Christmas 2008 Edition\n 2) Acronis Backup + Restore\n 3) Windows XP - Live Environment\n 4) Hiren's BootCD v9.6\n 5) SpinRite v6.1 (Hard Disk Testing and Repair)\n 6) Windows Memory Diagnostics (RAM Memory Testing)\n\n Help:\n\n Option 1 - Installs Windows TinyXP Professional SP3 with\n all hotfixes to December 2008 - includes optional drivers.\n\n Option 2 - Backup Windows, or restore a backup to your current partition.\n\n Option 3 - This boots straight into Windows XP so you can explore\n your drives whilst Windows is not running. Inc. Partition Manager.\n\n Option 4 - Tests your hard disk for errors and repairs it, if possible.\n\n Option 5 - Checks your computers RAM memory for any errors.\n\n Option 6 - Boots into Hiren's Boot CD, includes dozens of rescue tools.\n\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n The installation of TinyXP includes the following items,\n which are all automatically installed along with Windows:\n\n -All Hotfixes Up To December 2008 (inc. KB960714)\n\n -DirectX DLL Libraries (24 to 40)\n\n -Internet Explorer 7\n \n -Windows Media Player 11\n\n\n [OTHER INSTALLED PROGRAMS]\n\n -AllSnap v1.33.2\n (makes all windows snap together, like in Winamp)\n\n -Everything v1.1.4.301\n (Search Everything, extremely fast search tool)\n\n -Flash Player v10.0.12.36\n (for YouTube and other flash based sites)\n\n -GetDiz v4.1.0.6\n (default viewer for .NFO files)\n\n -HashTab v2.1.1\n (shows checksums on file properties)\n\n -Prio v1.9.8.1536\n (plug in, adds many features to Task Manager)\n\n -Royale Theme set as default\n (also includes Royale Noir)\n\n -WinRAR v3.80\n (most popular compression tool)\n\n\n NOTE: All the Start Menu entries are removed for the above programs,\n simply because you do not need anything on the Start Menu for any of\n these programs, so the Start Menu is kept nice and tidy.\n\n All these programs are very small and all of them can be uninstalled\n in Add/Remove programs, but why would you ever remove any of these!\n\n If you have never tried &quot;AllSnap&quot; or &quot;Everything&quot; before, you will be\n pleasantly surprised.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n Automatic Driver Installation...\n\n TinyXP includes drivers to cover the following:\n\n Chipset\n CPU\n LAN Ethernet\n SATA &amp; Mass Storage\n Sound Cards\n Wireless LAN\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n DOTNETFX folder (CD)\n \n Microsoft .NET Framework (all)\n\n The included file &quot;DOTNET.exe&quot; is a silent installer that will install:\n\n Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 SP1\n Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SP2\n Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 SP2\n Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1\n\n This silent installer of all .NET Framework updated editions is from\n the addon &quot;DotNetFx_All_In_1_Addon_v2.2.7z&quot; by jd976\n\n To install, just double click the file once. Then a command window will\n appear and stay on until the installation is complete.\n\n This replaces the old &quot;DOTNETFX&quot; folder on the original XP CD, which\n only contained the now outdated .NET 1.1 and was almost as big as this\n all in one silent installer is that has all versions.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n OEM folder (CD)\n\n If you want to install the drivers on this CD independently of\n installing Windows, this is now possible by running one BAT file.\n In the OEM folder on the CD you will find a file called:\n\n INSTALL DRIVERS.bat\n\n Run this INSTALL DRIVERS.bat file and sit back whilst the process unpacks\n the drivers, then tries to find any drivers you might need installing,\n then installs the drivers, then removes the initial drivers that were\n extracted, because they are not needed afterwards.\n\n You can run this INSTALL DRIVERS.bat file anytime, on any x86 Windows XP.\n\n Do not move the BAT file from the OEM folder. If the BAT file is not left\n where it is inside the OEM folder, it will not work.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n eXPerience folder (Desktop) \n\n Most of these folders contain quick solutions to things that otherwise\n would be buried away in the Windows GUI or require DOS style commands.\n E.g. &quot;control userpasswords2&quot; will open the screen to change your\n Windows XP login password, or &quot;intl.cpl&quot; runs the &quot;Regional and\n Language Options&quot; from Control Panel.\n\n FOLDERS:\n\n Desktop Icon Layout - Allows you to save your icon setup on the Desktop.\n Driver Install Tool - explains how to install drivers &quot;post install&quot;.\n Hibernation - Turns Hibernation on/off with one double click.\n Keyboard Settings - Quick way to open &quot;Regional and language Options&quot;\n Program Links - Download links to many great programs, all freeware.\n Registry Backup - Easily backup your registry in one double click.\n Services Configuration Files - Configure Windows to use less RAM.\n ShrinkXP Scripts - Removal of components whilst Windows is running.\n User Password - Easily change your password for Windows.\n\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n The breakdown of items that are removed is far too long to list here.\n\n You can easily check the 2 files in the &quot;INFO&quot; folder on the CD to see\n what exactly has been removed, or kept. There is a file for each thing,\n whats kept and whats removed, here on the CD:\n\n INFOWhats Kept.txt\n INFOWhats Removed.txt\n \n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n Statistics:\n\n RAM Usage On First Installation............ 85 Mb\n WINDOWS Folder............................. 630 Mb\n Processes.................................. 15*\n\n *Not including &quot;Everything.exe&quot; and &quot;allsnap.exe&quot;\n  which are uninstallable in Add/Remove programs.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n Don't forget To Join The Forum @ SnipeR's Redemption Network:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.retestrak.nl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.retestrak.nl/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n Enjoy this fine release from eXPerience \n\n Release Date : Christmas 2008\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5e4aff4fff87af177c1610eb60ecf0fe9fa1a0e","amp;dn":"TinyXP+Christmas+2008+Edition+-+eXPerience","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5e4aff4fff87af177c1610eb60ecf0fe9fa1a0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,228,175,244,255,248,122,241,119,193,97,14,182,14,207,15,233,250,26,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
