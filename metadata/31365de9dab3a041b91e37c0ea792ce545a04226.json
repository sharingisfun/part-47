They were quiet and fast, produced no exhaust and ran without gasoline...........Ten years later, these cars were destroyed.\n\nA lack of consumer confidence... or conspiracy?\n\nUnrest in the Middle East. Rising Petroleum Prices. Global Warming. There was an Alternative.\n\nThe purpose of this documentary is to educate and enlighten audiences with the story of this car. To show its place in history and in the larger story of our car culture and how it enables our continuing addiction to foreign oil. \n\nThis is an important message that not only calls to task the officials who squelched the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, but all of the other accomplices.  The government, the car companies, Big Oil, even Eco-darling Hydrogen as well as consumers, who turned their backs on the car and embraced instead the SUV. \n\nThis documentary investigates the death and resurrection of the electric car, as well as the role of renewable energy and sustainable living in our country's future.
