I used RegionFrii on it and changed it to this. Of course, you can change it back to any region if you wish, but it isn&amp;#039;t really necessary. The Update has been fully removed from the .ISO. Just download, burn and play!\n\nI have a WiiKey on 1.9s and the game boots every time.\n\nNOTE:\nYou MUST have a drive chip inside your Wii for this to boot. If not, the game WILL NOT boot. If you are on 3.3 of the Wii Firmware, then this game WILL NOT boot because it is Trucha Signed. You must therefore either use the downgrader or boot through Gecko OS.\n\nPlease seed. I am seeding until more seeds are added.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffb4d898552c4ffed512b012bca2207de08b6191","amp;dn":"Wario+Land%3A+Shake+PAL+-+Update+removed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffb4d898552c4ffed512b012bca2207de08b6191","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,180,216,152,85,44,79,254,213,18,176,18,188,162,32,125,224,139,97,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
