As most of these are pretty big, I will slow down older torrents for now until these are fully seeded.\n\nGame Name: Wii Spyfox Dry Cereal\nGame ID  : [RDLP70]\nLanguage : ENGLISH (maybe others, not checked)\nType     : Kids Adventure Puzzle\n\n** IMPORTANT **\nPlease seed to at least 200%/2.0 each (i've got my uTorrent set to 500%/5.0).\nDo not just leech and run. Help others get a chance to download it quickly too. I'm doing this to help. Please help too.\n\nAs ever, if you like it, maybe buy a Wii game to keep the franchise going as a thank-you for this freebie! Even better, get one not listed on here, and upload for me :-)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost of my 700+ of my Wii games are listed here (text file format directory listing):     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://txt.do/rbsm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://txt.do/rbsm&lt;/a&gt; \n\nFeel free to search and see if there is a missing one you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nPlease Google the title or game ID if you want to know about this or any of the other games, as I can't remember half of them myself to answer any questions. Also check YouTube for a review/demo of games, as some are pretty crap (like Ninjabread Man and the Billy the Wizard - that was so crap I deleted it straight away, so not got that anyway!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62ede8388430b526f3f475d0136e34a292598ca6","amp;dn":"Wii+Spyfox+Dry+Cereal+%5BRDLP70%5D+%5BWBFS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62ede8388430b526f3f475d0136e34a292598ca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,237,232,56,132,48,181,38,243,244,117,208,19,110,52,162,146,89,140,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
