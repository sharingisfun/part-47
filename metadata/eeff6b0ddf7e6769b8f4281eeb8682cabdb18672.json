Many PC users have become accustomed to bloated, system resource-hungry jukebox software that often puts style over substance. MediaMonkey won't reduce your PC to a crawl, but it will play, organise, and convert the most unwieldy MP3 collections with the minimum of fuss.\n\nFor those with ever-evolving music tastes, there is a multiple-folder file monitor that makes sure your library is always up to date. You can select individual tracks from different CDs to be ripped or just 'catalogued' onto your hard disk in one operation. For organisation, MediaMonkey can also label your entire MP3 collection in the same way.\n\nThe AutoPlaylist feature could be useful for those with large collections. It lets you create playlists by specifying criteria such as genre, artist or tempo. The program can to set to shut down your PC after playing and is compatible with most MP3 players.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeff6b0ddf7e6769b8f4281eeb8682cabdb18672","amp;dn":"Media+Monkey+Gold+3.0.1.1124+with+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeff6b0ddf7e6769b8f4281eeb8682cabdb18672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,255,107,13,223,126,103,105,184,244,40,30,235,134,130,202,189,177,134,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
