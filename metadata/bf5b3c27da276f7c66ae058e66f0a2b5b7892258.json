A compelling story of dictatorship, bloody battles, and endless courage as the Soviet people combat not only Hitler and the Germany Army, but their own leader as well. Hosted by former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, this 10-hour program features never-before-seen Russian images, once-secret documents, and leading Russian historians to explore Russia from 1924 through 1953.\n\nVol. 3: The Goths Ride East\n\nThe Germans invade the Soviet Union, leading to chaos and confusion as the Red Army falls back. Stalin, paralyzed by the shock, retreats to his dacha. Minsk, Kiev, and Smolensk fall. Stalin returns from hiding and signs the infamous Order 270, branding captured Soviet officers as traitors and committing their wives to forced labor. With the first snows, the Wehrmacht arrives at the gates of Moscow.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf5b3c27da276f7c66ae058e66f0a2b5b7892258","amp;dn":"Russia%5C%27s+War%3A+Blood+Upon+the+Snow+++%28Part+3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf5b3c27da276f7c66ae058e66f0a2b5b7892258","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,91,60,39,218,39,111,124,102,174,5,142,102,240,162,181,183,137,34,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
