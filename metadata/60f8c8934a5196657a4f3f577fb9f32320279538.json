The song was #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts for two weeks, from July 19 through August 1, 1980. The song is a cynical look at the music industry as a publicist/manager begs the protagonist (Joel) to remain hip for the younger crowd (&quot;What&amp;#039;s the matter with the car I&amp;#039;m driving? / &quot;Can&amp;#039;t you tell that it&amp;#039;s out of style?&quot;), and the protagonist&amp;#039;s refusal to change, claiming his music will remain relevant regardless of his appearance. The song was a stab by Joel at the new music genres that were around in the early 1980&amp;#039;s (punk, funk, new wave) and ironically almost uses a new wave sound. The music video has Joel, mixing elements of new wave, punk, and funk as he records a music video. The single reached &amp;#039;Platinum&amp;#039; certification from the RIAA for sales in the U.S.\n\n&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic did a parody of this song, in which he explains that Joel&amp;#039;s new sound for the song and the album, &quot;Glass Houses&quot; doesn&amp;#039;t change a thing; no matter what Joel&amp;#039;s sound in whatever he does, &quot;It&amp;#039;s Still Billy Joel to Me.&quot; The song was released on the CD set, &quot;Dr. Demento&amp;#039;s Basement Tapes&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60f8c8934a5196657a4f3f577fb9f32320279538","amp;dn":"Billy+Joel+-+It%5C%27s+Still+Rock+%26+Roll+To+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60f8c8934a5196657a4f3f577fb9f32320279538","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,248,200,147,74,81,150,101,122,79,63,87,127,185,243,35,32,39,149,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
