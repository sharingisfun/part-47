The record companies are not involved at all with this video except that they own(????) the artists. They really wants to kill the good stuff, even if they not are involved. The record companies greediness must be counteracted.\n\nBoth Marcus Miller and Keith Anderson have linked this video (from Fabchannel) to their own home sites. Those links are dead now.\n\nA friend of mine has recorded this with a chain of: computer, television, dvd-recorder and one week later it was gone from the web.\nSorry for the &quot;auto chapters&quot;.\n\nPlease download this masterpiece and seed it to the world!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a19b60072b8ad7e87581ba17b3be27a6932fedde","amp;dn":"Marcus+Miller+-+Paradiso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a19b60072b8ad7e87581ba17b3be27a6932fedde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,155,96,7,43,138,215,232,117,129,186,23,179,190,39,166,147,47,237,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
