Start the program, add a few files, change the name, hit the Build button and you are done. No scripts to learn, no seminars to attend.\n\nRead the Getting Started Tutorial to see how easy it really is.\n\nWindows software installerAdvanced Installer integrates in automated build tools\n\nThe Advanced Installer project files are stored in XML format. This way, they can be easily checked into a version control system. The software installer also operates at command line, so that you can build your release packages in a completely automated script, like Make, Ant or NAnt.\n\nFurther more, the most common operations are also implemented as command line actions, so you can modify your project in an automated fashion.\n\nInstallation tool for WindowsInstall and register the resources composing your application\n\nUsing Advanced Installer&amp;#039;s intuitive interface you can easily add to your install package all the resources your software requires:\n\n    * Files, Folders and Shortcuts (to installed files, existing files or URLs).\n    * Registry keys and entries.\n    * Environment Variables (which can be replace or be appended to existing variable like PATH).\n    * INI file entries.\n    * ODBC drivers, data sources and translators.\n\nIf you have merge modules for your components, they can be also added to the installation. Next you can register these resources as necessary:\n\n    * .Net and Win32 assemblies\n    * Services\n    * File Associations, MIME types\n    * Permissions for files, folders, registry keys and entries.\n\nIf a previous version of your product is found already installed on the target computer, Advanced Installer can upgrade it and ensure that older version will not be installed over newer ones.\n\nAdvanced software installation programSearch, download and install Prerequisites\n\nIf your application needs some other software to be installed in order to run, you can easily specify them as Prerequisites.
