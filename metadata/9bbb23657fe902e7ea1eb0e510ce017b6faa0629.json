In addition to firearms, you'll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan.\n\nYou'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. You'll also encounter five new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œuncommonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen.\n\nHelping to take L4D's frantic, action-packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0. This improved Director has the ability to procedurally change the weather you'll fight through and the pathways you'll take, in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match your performance. L4D2 promises a satisfying and uniquely challenging experience every time the game is played, custom-fitted to your style of play.\n\nHere's how to play without Steam mucking everything up, and how to update without the need for Steam:\n\n\nPrerequisites:\nMicrosoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 - Download and install: 32-bit or 64-bit\nMicrosoft's .net Framework 3.5 - Download and install .net 3.5\n\n\nQuick Setup:\n\nI.

Patch Game and play with Stryder's Loader:\n No reg-fixes needed.  Less CTDs than RevLoader.  Best method to play SP, LAN, and online.\n\nFirst make a backup of your origianl left4dead.exe before installing. \nInstall L4D2_Stryder_Loader_dec8.\nRun IniGen.exe in root L4D2 folder to generate a custom stryder.ini file for your system and\nset your in-game name.\nCreate a shortcut on your desktop to left4dead2.exe and click it to play!\n\nNOTE: Stryder's Loader will generate a log file [stryder.txt] and an error message after exiting the game.\n\nIV. Add Setti as the MasterServer:\n1. Download MasterServers.vdf from here: http://css.setti.info/code/masterserver/\n2. Create a folder named 'config' inside the 'bin' folder. [Ex. C:Program FilesLeft 4 Deadbinconfig]\n3. Copy MasterServers.vdf to the config folder, right click and set its attribute to read-only.\n4- Go to your L4D shortcut [used to launch game]. Right click it and select properties.\n5- In the shortcut tab, add -console -serverbrowser to the end of the target line. Click Apply and OK.\n6- Open the game, go into console and type: openserverbrowser.\n\nNOTE: PrivateCracked servers will now show up in the custom tab of the server browser.\nFavorite Servers can be saved as well as Server History.\n\n\n:DOWNLOADS:\n\n\nStryder's L4D2 Loader_dec8\n[new loader includes stryder's fixed left4dead2.exe, stryder.dll, ini generator\nand new Name_Enabler via inigen.exe] \nDownload from:-\n\nSetti MasterServer.vdf\nFor ServerBrowser Support of Private Servers.\nDirect Link\n\nCurrent Updates:\n\nFull Update:\n\nFull Update to 2.0.0.5\n[Repacked - now includes client and server files] \n[28.9MB exe  137 MB installed]\nL4D2_Full_Update_to_2.0.0.5.exe\nDownload from-\n\nFile Checker for v2005\nOpen this archive and extract it into yer Left 4 Dead Installation Folder.
