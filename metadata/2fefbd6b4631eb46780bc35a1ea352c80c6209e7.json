The Way Young Lovers Do\n\nNotes from Art Siegel and Craig Kerns:\nThis is the original disk in the Gets His Chance To Wail saga, which is described more fully here.\nThe 17 tracks on this one are from 1969-1971, and are mostly demos that would end up on Moondance,\nHis Band and the Street Choir, Tupelo Honey and several others. The only source info is &quot;Van Morrison,\nVocals, Guitar. All Tracks recorded 1969-71.&quot; The disc itself reads &quot;Gets His Change To Wail&quot;, while\nthe cover and spine are correct labelled. The tracks on this bootleg are identical to the later\nAnd It Stoned Me CD. It seems likely that And It Stoned Me was just cloned from Gets His Chance to Wail.\n\nThis bootleg is also largely the same as the Gypsy Soul: Lost Demos From a Classic Period without &quot;Ballerina.&quot;\n&quot;Lean On Me&quot; (track 7) is known as &quot;Hey, Where are You&quot; on Gypsy Soul, and &quot;Wasn't That a Time&quot; (track 10)\nis known as &quot;Rock and Roll Band&quot; (the title Van announces on the track).\n\nNote from Donna Burdick:\nAt the beginning of &quot;Domino&quot; there's a little of the studio discussion included and they decide to leave\nthe flute out of the mix. Then Van says, &quot;I think that's a better key for me; gives me a chance to 'wee-ale'\nmore.&quot; The accent kills me...I guess that's where &quot;gets his chance to wail&quot; comes from.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nPLEASE DO NOT CONVERT TO LOSSY FORMATS AND DISTRIBUTE IN PUBLIC\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n; flac fingerprint file generated by Trader's Little Helper\n; generated on February 19, 2011, at 11:19:17\n\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 01.flac:60adc394f56269d3c41e299720f009a1\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 02.flac:19ab2937a6032104336955dc4884a6ac\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 03.flac:7886318f04f60a32b7ae6a205f8c7c9f\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 04.flac:c58766f315d1f1817ce01402d7c2e41d\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 05.flac:e6e53a71351075db6829ad8a15f00541\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 06.flac:64454a90ab2ef45649b97caf581b25ed\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 07.flac:774a97e9eefff135e92e443cb445bc67\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 08.flac:f09ffffbef49447726ee306217fc6c65\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 09.flac:166df87542c5db3bf596ad5987cb0734\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 10.flac:42347f4ff26fd17f689576d4bdd9f8f6\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 11.flac:f94c812702c2a2ad1f52cb0650d476a2\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 12.flac:43057c4f379cd4f5792cb081d9e3fc8a\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 13.flac:b9e176fc429f1de28a2b3c0ce4643d76\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 14.flac:12729e36e883f18116ba234760b788f1\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 15.flac:5b721f1e08a9471f04e8c9a3e0987a85\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 16.flac:d0781a782fbfde9ae99707defdc2680f\nVan Morrison - Gets His Chance To Wail_Track 17.flac:6ad6ab0f5ef2622b20763e6ef52f2e8b\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fefbd6b4631eb46780bc35a1ea352c80c6209e7","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+Gets+His+Chance+To+Wail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fefbd6b4631eb46780bc35a1ea352c80c6209e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,239,189,107,70,49,235,70,120,11,195,90,30,163,82,200,12,98,9,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
