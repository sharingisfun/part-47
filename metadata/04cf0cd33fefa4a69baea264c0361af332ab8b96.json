However it is much more than a book on peer orientation: it is about parenting with relationship in mind. This book restores parents to their natural intuition, confronting such relationship devastating devices as time-outs and using what children care about against them. Offering effective strategies for preserving and restoring the child-to-parent relationship, this book provides refreshing natural alternatives to today's contrived methods of behaviour control. The content is relevant to parents of children of any age, from infants right through to adult children. Readers have commonly commented on how much hardship and confusion they could have avoided had this material been available to them right from the beginning.\n\nThis book was first released in Canada where it became a bestseller within weeks. It is now available in the US and several other languages including French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese (Brazil), Hebrew, Swedish, Norwegian and Korean.\n\n\n'Dr. Neufeld's approach has the power to change, if not save, the lives of our children.'\n-The National Post\n\n\n-------------\n\nSee also\n\n* Attachment theory\n* Attachment parenting\n\n-------------\n\nGordon Neufeld: 2 DVD sets\n\n==========================\n\n-Making Sense of Counterwill\n2 DVD Disc set, approx 2 hours per disc\nTotal Runtime ~4 hours\nVideo: 360x270 pixels FFmpeg MPEG-4\n30 frames per second\nmencoder vcodec=mpeg4:vhq:v4mv:vqmin=2:vbitrate=1398\nAudio: MPEG 1 Audio, Laver 3 (MP3)\nStereo 48000Hz bitrate:113kbps\n\nNEW RELEASE - Making Sense of Counterwill - a four session videocourse\n\nThe instinct to resist being controlled or coerced is one of the most perplexing and troublesome dynamics in dealing with children and youth.

Dr. Neufeld reveals the dynamics controlling this instinct and provides suggestions for how to deal with this troubling phenomenon. This material is applicable for all adults dealing with toddlers through adolescents - teachers, parents and helping professionals. Participants find the insights highly enlightening and life-changing. This material is suitable for both self and group study.

Every child gets stuck from time to time on the road to maturation and every parent faces challenges at some point on the journey. At these times, we could benefit from experienced insight and practical suggestions that are in the best interest of our children. In this third part of the Power to Parent series, Dr. Neufeld helps equip parents to read the signs of a child in trouble, live with a sensitive child, cultivate resilience in a child, lead an alpha child, soften a defended child, discipline a stuck child, and more. Dr. Neufeld offers effective and safe practices that honor and preserve the relationship, even when the problems seem daunting. In making sense of a child's experience, parents are better prepared to lead them through challenging times.\n\n-------------\n\nDVD Ripped on Ubuntu 10.04LTS Lucid Lynx\ntried to use k3b, Acidrip, DVD:Rip, and Nero Linux but none properly would read the disc even though it isn't encrypted! So I ended up using Acidrip as a guide to just do it on the command line with mencoder. I've compressed the files quite a lot to save space and because you don't need high resolution for something like this lecture style video.\n\nPictures edited with gThumb and a script that calls Imagemagick\n\n--------------\n\nDr. Gordon Neufeld is a Vancouver-based developmental psychologist who consults with parents and professionals regarding children and their problems. He brings to us his unique synthesis of the developmental literature and his exceptional ability to make children understandable. He has a widespread reputation for being able to make sense of difficult and complex problems and for opening doors for change. His style is dynamic, his approach is refreshing and his effect is to affirm intuition.\nBiographical Information\n\n\n--------------\nIn theory there is no difference between theory and practice.
