Dexter begins to question his blind loyalty to his father's memory. After an act of spontaneity, he wonders whether The Code of Harry is a necessity anymore. Meanwhile, Angel is promoted to Sergeant, replacing the deceased Doakes. Dexter goes to desperate measures to cover up his latest kill, revealed to be the brother of ADA Miguel Prado, who has history with Lt. LaGuerta. \n\n2 \t26 \t&quot;Finding Freebo&quot;   \nDexter and Rita have to make a big decision about their family, forcing Dexter to think about what it means to be responsible for kids. Meanwhile, Dexter and Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado find themselves hunting down the same man, Freebo, the man accused of killing MiguelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brother. As a result, Debra and the Homicide department are tasked to find Freebo. Dexter gets a surprise at the site of his latest kill. \n\n3 \t27 \t&quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;   \nWhile grocery shopping with Rita and the kids, Dexter comes across a fellow predator, a pedophile. After the pedophile is seen talking with Astor, Dexter must decide if he fits The Code. Meanwhile, Debra has a new homicide to solve, a mysteriously skinned Jane Doe that the police link to Freebo. But Dexter knows that Freebo is not the culprit, so he must find a way to help Debra identify their murder victim, thus proving that Freebo didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t commit the crime. \n\n4 \t28 \t&quot;All In The Family&quot; \t\nAfter a botched marriage proposal, Dexter has to figure out how to convince Rita that he is looking for more than a convenient merger of finances and fatherhood. But Deb's case of a woman's murdered fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e offers hope for Dexter in strange ways. Meanwhile, Miguel's brother, Ramon, is going off the rails in the hunt for their little brother Oscar's murderer. \n\n5 \t29 \t&quot;Turning Biminese&quot; \t\nMiguel tells Dexter about a husband who has gotten away with killing two of his wives for financial gain. For Dexter, this seems like the perfect candidate to satisfy his dark urge and his need, like every man under relationship pressures, to get away. Dexter tracks the murderer to Bimini, but while on the hunt Rita has a medical emergency and Dexter is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, Debra works with Anton but finds herself oddly attracted to him. \n\n6 \t30 \t&quot;SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ Se Puede&quot; \t\nGrappling with what to do with his newfound friend Miguel (who thinks he is clued in to DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vigilante ways), Dexter decides to test him to see how far he wants to go but is surprised to find that Miguel is not only on board, but also has a daring strategy to complete DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dark plan. Rita gets fired from her job, leaving her wondering if she will ever have a real career, while Debra is upset when she realizes she may be partially responsible for another mysteriously skinned homicide case sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trying to solve. \n\n7 \t31 \t&quot;Easy As Pie&quot; \t\nMiguel offers Dexter a new potential victim, but after properly vetting her, Dexter isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sure she fits the Code. When he informs Miguel of this, Miguel reacts with anger, making Dexter believe the new friendship is in danger, an idea reinforced when an old sickly friend of DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s asks him to help end her life, insisting she would never ask a friend to do something against his conscience. Meanwhile, Rita finds out that Sylvia is beginning to suspect her husband, Miguel, is having an affair. Debra ends up revealing to Anton that he is being used as bait to lure the Skinner, forcing her to find new way to find the Skinner, with the result that Anton realizes Debra cares for him more than he thought. \n\n8 \t32 \t&quot;The Damage A Man Can Do&quot; \t\nMiguel brings Dexter another ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œproject,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but this time he wants to get his hands dirty, and Dexter realizes itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to teach Miguel the Code ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ for his own safety as well as MiguelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. As Dexter walks Miguel through the process, Dexter struggles with (and enjoys) letting Miguel into his private world so completely, but doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t realize that this has only whetted MiguelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s appetite. Rita finds herself losing control because of the pregnancy and becomes worried that Dexter may get fed up with her. Because of her hard work, Debra finds herself one step closer to catching the Skinner, but after she finds out a secret about her new boyfriend Anton, he disappears on her. \n\n9 \t33 \t&quot;About Last Night&quot; \t\nDexter starts to fear that Miguel may have strayed from the newly taught Code, and this concern starts to put a strain on their friendship. And Dexter doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get a reprieve from this at RitaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s either: Sylvia, noting how Miguel is never at home anymore, tells Rita that she is now convinced that Miguel is having an affair, and Rita decides to confront Miguel about his indiscretions. Meanwhile, Anton is confirmed to have been taken by the Skinner, sending Debra into a furious search not only for Anton but also for his potential killer. \n\n10 \t34 \t&quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; \t\nDexter feels like heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s making a deal with the devil when he feigns civility around Miguel after Miguel's duplicitous ways as he finds himself in a series of chess-like moves against his former friend, all the while hoping that Miguel doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get the upper hand and watching helplessly as Miguel draws Rita closer through a wonderful wedding gift. Debra, now back with Anton after his close call with the Skinner, wonders if her relationship with Anton is worth putting her career in jeopardy. Relations between Miguel and Dexter deteriorates, and Dexter decides to kill Miguel. Dexter, however, ends up getting kidnapped, supposedly by the Skinner, who has been informed by Miguel that Dexter is the only person who knows Freebo's location. \n\n11 \t35 \t&quot;I Had a Dream&quot; \t\nWhile preparing for his big wedding day, Dexter has to figure out a way to remove Miguel from his life for good, but how does Dexter manage to do this when Miguel is not only a highly placed D.A. but also his Best Man? Rita has troubles of her own when Syl reveals that Miguel has been seeing one of his old flames. Meanwhile, Debra finds a new clue that brings her even closer to catching the Skinner. \n\n12 \t36 \t&quot;Do You Take Dexter Morgan?&quot; \t\nWith Miguel out of the picture, DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s focus shifts to calming his emotionally unstable brother Ramon. Upon easing RamonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s concerns, Dexter can finally breathe again. All that stands before him now is his wedding with Rita ... until heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s met with yet another deadly surprise. Meanwhile, Batista informs Debra that she will receive her DetectiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s shield, but is instantly blindsided with information that could potentially derail her promotion.
