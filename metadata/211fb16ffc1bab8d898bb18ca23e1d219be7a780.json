The band was labelled a supergroup and included former members of veteran\nprogressive rock bands Yes, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Uriah Heep, U.K., Roxy Music, Wishbone Ash and The Buggles.\nSince 2007, there have been two distinct groups using the Asia name: a reunion of the band's original line-up\nperforming as Asia, and Asia Featuring John Payne as a continuation of the pre-2006 Asia line-up,\ninitially featuring three of its members.\n\nIncludes the complete albums ASIA (1982), ALPHA (1983), and ASTRA (1986), plus bonus tracks.\n\nA re-pressing of 2002's excellent Anthologia: 20th Anniversary Geffen Years Collection,\nthis isn't just a loosely assembled collection of Asia's finest moments -- it's everything but the kitchen sink and\nbandmember arguments caught on tape. For diehards who missed its initial pressing, this second time around is redemption.\nThis, quite simply, delivers everything fans could ever want (and in some cases need) from the supergroup\nthat was at the top of the arena rock game during the '80s. However, those who aren't die-hard loyalists would be\nbetter served by checking out 2003's 20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: &quot;The Best of Asia&quot;\nas a viable substitute and a filler-free, less intimidating entry point into the group's catalog.\n\nTrackList:\n\nDISC 1:\n\n\n01. &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot;\n02. &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot;\n03. &quot;Sole Survivor&quot;\n04. &quot;One Step Closer&quot;\n05. &quot;Time Again&quot;\n06. &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;\n07. &quot;Without You&quot;\n08. &quot;Cutting It Fine&quot;\n09. &quot;Here Comes the Feeling&quot;\n10. &quot;Ride Easy&quot;\n11. &quot;Don't Cry&quot;\n12. &quot;The Smile Has Left Your Eyes&quot;\n13. &quot;Never In A Million Years&quot;\n14. &quot;My Own Time&quot; (I'll Do What I Want)\n15. &quot;The Heat Goes On&quot;\n16. &quot;Eye To Eye&quot;\n17. &quot;The Last To Know&quot;\n18. &quot;True Colors&quot;\n\nDISC 2:\n\n\n01. &quot;Midnight sun&quot;\n02. &quot;Open your eyes&quot;\n03. &quot;Daylight&quot;\n04. &quot;Lyin' To Yourself&quot;\n05. &quot;Go&quot;\n06. &quot;Voice Of America&quot;\n07. &quot;Hard On Me&quot;\n08. &quot;Wishing&quot;\n09. &quot;Rock And Roll Dream&quot;\n10. &quot;Countdown To Zero&quot;\n11. &quot;Love Now Till Eternity&quot;\n12. &quot;Too Late&quot;\n13. &quot;Suspicion&quot;\n14. &quot;After The War&quot;\n15. &quot;Am I In Love?&quot;\n16. &quot;Summer&quot; (Can't Last Too Long)\n17. &quot;Prayin' 4 A Miracle&quot;\n18. &quot;Days Like These&quot;\n\n\nAudio\n\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 1 034 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:211fb16ffc1bab8d898bb18ca23e1d219be7a780","amp;dn":"ASIA+-+%5C%22Anthologia%5C%22+The+20th+Anniversary+%2F+Geffen+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"211fb16ffc1bab8d898bb18ca23e1d219be7a780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,31,177,111,252,27,171,141,137,139,177,140,162,62,29,33,155,231,167,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
